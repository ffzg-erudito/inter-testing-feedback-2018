October 2018


This repository contains `Python` scripts and ancillary files for running an 
experiment designed for investigating the forward testing effect, as well as the

# Contents

`design.md` contains short description of design, and has the write up of the
hypothses.

## `analyses`

This folder contains the data (`data/`), data preparation (`wrangling/`) and
analyses scripts (`stats/`). `images/` and `helpers/` contain auxiliary files.
The analysis plan is written up in `analysis-plan.md`. It also contains power
curves for the study, with final sample size and predicted sample size after
exclusion cirteria are applied.

### `data`

`results.csv` is the main data file.

`for-bayes/` contains filtered datasets used in JASP. Same data as used in the
first and second MANOVA.

## `informed-consent`

The informed consent forms files.

## `paper`

Files for compiling the article.

## `scripts`

### `exp-application`

The `oTree` app. Too deep to explain further.

### `misc`
