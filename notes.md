## Random experiment notes

# NOTES ON FEEDBACK:

- feedback is to be provided immediately after the participant submits their answer to each question, 
on the same .html page the question was posed. The reason for this is that we want to ensure, to the 
extent this is even possible to begin with, that participants process the feedback. We reasoned that
if we provide feedback about the correctness of their replies on a single page after the last question,
participants would more likely skim through the correct answers (especially in the case where the
interpolated activity was arithmetic) rather than attentively go through their answers and given feedback

- it was decided after all that feedback will be given after the participant answered all the questions
pertaining to a particular test. Feedback is given in a tabular format, containing in rows the question,
the participant given answer, and the correct answer for that question. As per the issue of whether
participants will just skim through or process the feedback thoroughly, we attempted to ensure that they
indeed process it through the following manipulations. First of all, when the feedback is displayed, 
proceeding to the next display is disabled for 40 seconds, after which a "Next" button appeared at the 
bottom of the table. By clicking on this button at will, participants were allowed to proceed to the next
display. After an additional 20 seconds, though, the protocol proceeded automatically.
