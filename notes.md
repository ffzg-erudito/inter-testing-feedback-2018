## Random experiment notes
- feedback is to be provided immediately after the participant submits their answer to each question, 
on the same .html page the question was posed. The reason for this is that we want to ensure, to the 
extent this is even possible to begin with, that participants process the feedback. We reasoned that
if we provide feedback about the correctness of their replies on a single page after the last question,
participants would more likely skim through the correct answers (especially in the case where the
interpolated activity was arithmetic) rather than attentively go through their answers and given feedback
