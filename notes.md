## EXPERIMENT NOTES

# INTRO
- the aim of this study is to investigate the forward testing effect (Yang, Potts & Shanks, 2018),
also known as the interpolated testing effect (Szpunar, Khan & Schacter, 2013), the interim test effect
(Wissman, Rawson & Pyc, 2011), or test-potentiated new learning (Chan, Meissner & Davis, 2018).
Commonly, testing (i.e. retrieval) is promoted as a means to enhance long-term memory of the studied
material. However, during the last decade, a number of studies reported that, apart from strengthening 
long-term memory of that which *was* learned, attempts to retrieve that which was learned can boost 
learning of that which *will be* learned. In other words, if, after learning some content, participants
are asked to retrieve it, and then asked to learn some other, new content, they achieve better 
results at a subsequent test aimed at assessing memory of the other, new content, than if they are
asked to merely restudy the first content.


# GOAL, PROBLEMS
- although it is relatively well documented by now, the mechanisms that give rise to the forward testing 
effect have not been elucidated yet. Chan, Meissner & Davis (2018) have provided an overview of the 
frameworks that attempt to explain the effect, and conclude that introducing feedback to the study 
proceedure might be a way to differentiate between two prominent explanations. We decided to do exactly
this, so we asked what the effect of feedback on our dependent variable would be? Therefore, one of our
independent variables (IVs) is feedback, with two levels:
1. feedback is given
2. feedback is not given

- our second IV is the type of activity interpolated between subsequent phases of reading/studying.
Previous studies usually pitched *retrieval of the studied materials* against *rereading/restudying
the studied materials*. However, some studies suggest that other types of cognitive activity besides
retrieval achieve the same effect. For example, Pastötter, Schicker, Niedernhuber & Bäuml (2011)
found the same effect for retrieval from semantic memory (generation of exemplars from a specified
category) and from a short-term memory task (2-back task) as well. We therefore included three 
cognitive activities as the levels of the 2nd IV:
1. rereading/restudying the studied materials
2. retrieval of the studied materials
3. retrieval of general knowledge

- published studies usually use simple study materials like lists of words or word pairs. Having in mind
the desirability of ecological validity, we decided to use more complex study materials. We constructed
a series of three text passages (1. 875 words, 2. 763 words, 3. 872 words) about weeds - a subject we 
assumed our participants would be unknowledgable about. Our main dependent variable (DV) is the 
performance on a test comprised of 20 multiple choice questions following the final text passage and 
pertaining to that final text passage. Participants were given 4 possible answers to choose from, one of 
which was correct, and the other three were distractors. One of the distractors was designed in such a 
way so as to be particularly luring on account of it being related to the 2nd text passage, not the 3rd 
and final one. Our 2nd DV was the number of these lures selected in the final test.


# DESIGN BASICS
- we will employ a 2x2 design with a conceptually separate control group, which amounts to
five experimental conditions. The IVs are the type of interpolated activity and feedback, 
while the DVs are the number of correct answers on the final test and the number of lures selected
on the final test


# PROCEEDURE
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the 5 conditions. Participants were then given detailed
instructions about what to expect to encounter during the study and what their task would be. At the very
beginning, all participants entered their ID, age and sex. They then estimated their present knowledge about
weeds on a scale ranging from 1 to 7 (where 1 means no knowledge of the subject). 

After that they were instructed to read a passage of text (768 words) from beginning to end once, 
at a rate which comes naturally to them, and to click on a button at the bottom of the passage when they've 
read the text once. Apart from serving a familiarisation role, the time it took a participant to read this
initial practice passage was used as a basis on which an estimate for future reading time limits were set. 
Results of a pilot study found that most participants found 4 minutes to be too short, and 9 minutes to be 
too long. We therefore set the lowest possible estimate to be 5 minutes, and the longest one to be 8 minutes. 

After this passage, depending on the condition they were assigned to, participants were familiarised with the 
interpolated activity they are going to perform during the main part of the proceedure (e.g. the rereading 
group reread the practice passage, while the content test group answered four questions pertaining to the 
content of the practice text passage). **All** participants were told that, after the 3rd and final text 
passage, they are going to answer questions pertaining to the content of **ALL** the passages (barring the 
practice passage). Since the effect under examination is the forward testing effect, this final collection 
of questions, in actuality, only assessed knowledge about the content in the final passage of text.

The participants that were randomly assigned to the group which was given feedback was also familiarised
with the form feedback was going to be given in, and they were told to study the feedback because the final
test would assess their knowledge of all the text they would read.

After this, participants read the first passage of text, and subsequently engaged in their designated
activities: one group of participants was given an additional time period of equal length to their initial
reading time estimate, during which they were to reread the text, one group answered questions about 
*the content in the text*, while the last group answered *general knowledge questions*. Within the groups 
that answered questions, subgroups were formed based on the level of the feedback IV. After completing 
their respective tasks (and studied the feedback), all participants read the 2nd passage, after which 
they again completed the task corresponding to the condition they were assigned to. After that they 
read the final text passage, after which all participants answered 20 questions pertaining to the final 
text passage.


# FEEDBACK
- feedback is to be provided immediately after the participant submits their answer to each question, 
on the same .html page the question was posed. The reason for this is that we want to ensure, to the 
extent this is even possible to begin with, that participants process the feedback. We reasoned that
if we provide feedback about the correctness of their replies on a single page after the last question,
participants would more likely skim through the correct answers (especially in the case where the
interpolated activity was arithmetic) rather than attentively go through their answers and given feedback

- it was decided after all that feedback will be given after the participant answered all the questions
pertaining to a particular test. Feedback is given in a tabular format, containing in rows the question,
the participant given answer, and the correct answer for that question. As per the issue of whether
participants will just skim through or process the feedback thoroughly, we attempted to ensure that they
indeed process it through the following manipulations. First, when the feedback is displayed, proceeding 
to the next display is disabled for 40 seconds, after which a "Next" button appears at the bottom of the
table. By clicking on this button at will, participants are allowed to proceed to the next display. 
After an additional 20 seconds, though, the protocol proceeds automatically. Secondly, participants are
informed during the instructions phase that, after they've read the final text, they will be asked
questions pertaining to all three texts, whereby we ask them that they therefore study the given feedback
