## EXPERIMENT NOTES

# INTRO
- the aim of this study is to investigate the forward testing effect (Yang, Potts & Shanks, 2018),
also known as the interpolated testing effect (Szpunar, Khan & Schacter, 2013), the interim test effect
(Wissman, Rawson & Pyc, 2011), or test-potentiated new learning (Chan, Meissner & Davis, 2018).
Commonly, testing (i.e. retrieval) is promoted as a means to enhance long-term memory of the studied
material. However, during the last decade, a number of studies reported that, apart from strengthening 
long-term memory of that which *was* learned, attempts to retrieve that which was learned can boost 
learning of that which *will be* learned. In other words, if, after learning some content, participants
are asked to retrieve it, and then asked to learn some other, new content, they achieve better 
results at a subsequent test aimed at assessing memory of the other, new content, than if they are
asked to merely restudy the first content.


# GOAL, PROBLEMS
- although it is relatively well documented by now, the mechanisms that give rise to the forward testing 
effect have not been elucidated yet. Chan, Meissner & Davis (2018) have provided an overview of the 
frameworks that attempt to explain the effect, and conclude that introducing feedback to the study 
procedure might be a way to differentiate between two prominent explanations. 
  *Resource theories* claim that interpolated testing reduces proactive interference during the encoding of
new materials or by increasing attentional resources that are available for post-retrieval encoding. 
Theories in this category claim that interpolated tests should reduce the likelihood of intrusions from 
original learning during new learning, whilst helping participants sustain attention on the encoding task 
through "resetting" of the encoding process (Pastötter et al., 2011). On the other hand, *integration 
theories* propose that testing enhances the accessibility of original learning, which should, actually, 
increase the probability of intrusions, i.e. spontaneous retrievals of original learning. Thus, covert 
retrieval promotes binding of original and new information into an integrated representation, which 
improves conceptual organisation and the effectivness of retrieval cues at the time of test.
  Having opposing predictions regarding the influence of intrusions on the forward testing effect, and
since corrective feedback, purportedly, increases the likelihood of intrusions during new learning, we 
decided to pit these two frameworks against each other by asking what the effect of feedback on our 
dependent variables would be? Therefore, one of our independent variables (IVs) is feedback, with two levels:
1. feedback is given
2. feedback is not given

- our second IV is the type of activity interpolated between subsequent phases of reading/studying.
Previous studies usually pitched *retrieval of the studied materials* against *rereading/restudying
the studied materials*. However, some studies suggest that other types of cognitive activity besides
retrieval of the studied material achieve the same effect. For example, Pastötter, Schicker, 
Niedernhuber & Bäuml (2011) found the same effect for retrieval from semantic memory (generation of 
exemplars from a specified category) and from a short-term memory task (2-back task) as well. 
We therefore included three cognitive activities as the levels of the 2nd IV:
1. rereading/restudying the studied materials
2. retrieval of the studied materials
3. retrieval of general knowledge

- published studies usually use simple study materials like lists of words or word pairs. Having in mind
the desirability of ecological validity, we decided to use more complex study materials. We constructed
a series of three text passages (1. 874 words, 2. 754 words, 3. 835 words) about weeds - a subject we 
assumed our participants would be unknowledgable about. Our main dependent variable (DV) is the 
performance on a test comprised of 20 multiple choice questions following the final text passage and 
pertaining to that final text passage. Participants were given 4 possible answers to choose from, one of 
which was correct, and the other three were distractors. 
  One of the distractors was designed in such a way so as to be particularly luring on account of it being 
related to the 2nd text passage, not the 3rd and final one. We assumed that selecting these luring options 
could provide an indication of the influence of covert retrievals (i.e. "intrusions") from older learning on 
the retrieval of new learning. Our 2nd DV was the number of these lures selected in the final test. As stated
above, according to resource theories, "intrusions" should decrease the forward testing effect. Therefore, the 
influence of feedback should decrease the number of selected luring options.

Given the above, these are our problems:
1. Does the type of interpolated activity influence learning from complex materials?
1. Does the type of interpolated activity interact with feedback presentation when learning from complex
materials?

# HYPOTHESES
 
1. Interpolated testing increases the effectiveness of future learning. Compared to the rereading group,
participants in the retrieval groups should have a significantly higher average total score on the final test.
Furthermore, following the results of some studies, we expect to find no difference between the two
groups having different types of retrieval, which is in accordance with resource theories.

1. Participants in the content-related test condition will have the lowest proportion of intrusive choices
among uncorrect answers, followed by participants in the general knowledge condition, and finally by the
participans in the rereading condition. We expect all three differences to be statistically significant. 

1. When looking at the content-related and general knowledge test groups (which were the only ones who
had both levels of the feedback IV), we suspect to find a significant main effect of feedback on the average number
of correctly answered questions.

1. Furthermore, we expect to find an interaction between feedback presentation and type of interpolated
activity. Specifically, we assume that presenting feedback will have a positive effect on the average
number of correctly answered questions, but only for the participants in the content-related test condition.
The remaining three groups will not differ.

1. There will be a main effect of feedback on the average proportion of chosen intrusive distractors. Participants
receiving feedback will have a significantly higher average proportion of chosen instrusive distractors
than participants receiving no feedback.

1. We also expect to find an interaction effect of activity type and feedback presentation on the
proportion of intrusive distractors chosen, but cannot set a specific hypothesis regearding its
pattern.

# DESIGN BASICS
- we will employ a 2x2 design with a conceptually separate control group, which amounts to
five experimental conditions. The IVs are the type of interpolated activity and feedback, 
while the DVs are the number of correct answers on the final test and the number of lures selected
on the final test


# PROCEDURE
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the 5 conditions. They were first given a brief oral introduction
to the study, and brief motivational instructions to encourage them to carefully read the written instructions,
and to adhere to the specifications of the tasks. They were then assigned to one of six compartments containin
a computer with requisite input and output devices. Participants were seated in front of the computer monitor,
where they followed the prompts to receive detailed instructions about what to expect to encounter during the 
study and what their task would be. At the very beginning, all participants entered their ID, age and sex.

After that they were instructed to read a passage of text (768 words) from beginning to end once, 
at a rate which comes naturally to them, and to click on a button at the bottom of the passage when they've 
read the text once. Apart from serving a familiarisation role, the time it took a participant to read this
initial practice passage was used as a basis on which an estimate for future reading time limits were set. 
Results of a pilot study found that most participants found 4 minutes to be too short, and 9 minutes to be 
too long. We therefore set the lowest possible estimate to be 5 minutes, and the longest one to be 8 minutes. 

After this passage, depending on the condition they were assigned to, participants were familiarised with the 
interpolated activity they are going to perform during the main part of the procedure (e.g. the rereading 
group reread the practice passage, while the content test group answered four questions pertaining to the 
content of the practice text passage). **All** participants were told that, after the 3rd and final text 
passage, they are going to answer questions pertaining to the content of **ALL** the passages (barring the 
practice passage). Since the effect under examination is the forward testing effect, this final collection 
of questions, in actuality, only assessed knowledge about the content in the final passage of text.

The participants that were randomly assigned to the group which was given feedback was also familiarised
with the form feedback was going to be given in, and they were told to study the feedback because the final
test would assess their knowledge of all the text they would read.

After this, participants read the first passage of text, and subsequently engaged in their designated
activities: one group of participants was given an additional time period of equal length to their initial
reading time estimate, during which they were to reread the text, one group answered questions about 
*the content in the text*, while the last group answered *general knowledge questions*. Within the groups 
that answered questions, subgroups were formed based on the level of the feedback IV. After completing 
their respective tasks (and studied the feedback), all participants read the 2nd passage, after which 
they again completed the task corresponding to the condition they were assigned to. After that they 
read the final text passage, after which all participants answered 20 questions pertaining to the final 
text passage.


# FEEDBACK
- feedback is to be provided immediately after the participant submits their answer to each question, 
on the same .html page the question was posed. The reason for this is that we want to ensure, to the 
extent this is even possible to begin with, that participants process the feedback. We reasoned that
if we provide feedback about the correctness of their replies on a single page after the last question,
participants would more likely skim through the correct answers (especially in the case where the
interpolated activity was arithmetic) rather than attentively go through their answers and given feedback

- it was decided after all that feedback will be given after the participant answered all the questions
pertaining to a particular test. Feedback is given in a tabular format, containing in rows the question,
the participant given answer, and the correct answer for that question. As per the issue of whether
participants will just skim through or process the feedback thoroughly, we attempted to ensure that they
indeed process it through the following manipulations. First, when the feedback is displayed, proceeding 
to the next display is disabled for 40 seconds, after which a "Next" button appears at the bottom of the
table. By clicking on this button at will, participants are allowed to proceed to the next display. 
After an additional 20 seconds, though, the protocol proceeds automatically. Secondly, participants are
informed during the instructions phase that, after they've read the final text, they will be asked
questions pertaining to all three texts, whereby we ask them that they therefore study the given feedback
