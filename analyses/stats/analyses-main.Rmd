Prior to analysing the data, we have excluded participants based on a priori
set criteria. Participants who have spent less than or equal to 90 seconds
on the practice text were excluded
(`r nrow(dat) - dat %>% filter(., readingTime > 90) %>% nrow(.)` exclusion).
Further, we wanted to exclude participants who have had no correct answers on
the final test
(`r dat %>% filter(., readingTime > 90) %>% nrow(.) -
{dat %>% filter(., readingTime > 90 & totalCorrect > 0) %>% nrow(.)}` exclusions).
Finally, we have excluded participants who have stated that they have reading
deficits
(`r dat %>% filter(., readingTime > 90 & totalCorrect > 0) %>% nrow(.) -
{dat %>% filter(., readingTime > 90 & totalCorrect > 0 &
readingDeficits == 'NE')%>% nrow(.)}` exclusions). This left us with a total sample
of `r nrow(datHard)` participants. The descriptives for the sample are shown
in Table \ref{descTable}.
There is another set of exclusion criteria
based on the number of times the participants have read each of the three texts.
These are used in robustness check analyses (see suplementary materials).

### Interpolated activity effect

```{r datHardNofeedFilter}
datHardNofeed <- datHard %>% filter(., giveFeedback == F) %>%
  select(., activityFactor, totalCorrect, totalIntrusors)
datHardNofeed$activityFactor %<>% as.factor(.)
```

Our first two hypotheses are concerned with the effects of different interpolated
activities on the total number of correct answers and total number of intrusive
distractors chosen. To test these hypotheses, we have focused only on the groups
which have not received feedback, since there was no feedback option for the
rereading group (\(n\) = `r nrow(datHardNofeed)`).
We conducted a one-way MANOVA with interpolated activity as
the independent variable and the total number of correct and intrusive options
chosen as dependent variables. The correlation between our DVs calculated on the
whole sample is
`r datHard %>% select(totalCorrect, totalIntrusors) %>% corr.test(.) -> .;
pluck(., 'r') %>% .[1,2] %>% round(., 2)`
(95% CI: [`r pluck(., 'ci') %>% pull(lower) %>% round(., 2)`,
`r pluck(., 'ci') %>% pull(upper) %>% round(., 2)`],
\(p\) = \(`r datHard %>% select(totalCorrect, totalIntrusors) %>% corr.test(.) -> .;
pluck(., 'p') %>% .[1,2]`\)). Boxplots for the groups in this analysis are shown
in Figure \ref{box1}.

```{r boxPlot, include = T, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = '\\label{box1} Boxplots broken down by experimental condition and dependent variable, with overlayed raw scores.', fig.env = 'figure*', message = F}
datHardNofeed %>%
  mutate_at(vars(activityFactor), fct_relevel,
            'rereading', 'general', 'content') %>%
  mutate_at(vars(activityFactor), fct_recode,
            'Rereading' = 'rereading', 'General' = 'general',
            'Content' = 'content') %>%
  gather(., totalCorrect, totalIntrusors, key = 'dependentVar',
         value = 'score') %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = activityFactor, y = score)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = .5) + geom_dotplot(mapping = aes(y = score),
                                          binaxis = 'y',
                                stackdir = 'centerwhole', dotsize = .5,
                                fill = 'black', color = 'black') +
  xlab('Condition') + ylab('Score') +
  facet_grid(dependentVar~.,
             labeller = as_labeller(c('totalCorrect' = 'Total correct',
                                      'totalIntrusors' = 'Total intrusors'))) +
  theme(panel.spacing.y = unit(2, 'line'))
```

```{r manovaInterpActivity}
manovaModel <- manova(data = datHardNofeed,
                      cbind(totalCorrect, totalIntrusors) ~ activityFactor)
```

Pillai's V for the analysis is
`r summary(manovaModel) %>% pluck(., 'stats') %>% .[1, 'Pillai']`,
\(p\) = `r summary(manovaModel) %>% pluck(., 'stats') %>% .[1, 'Pr(>F)']`
(Wilks' \(\Lambda\) =
`r summary(manovaModel, test = 'Wilks') %>% pluck(., 'stats') %>% .[1, 'Wilks']`,
\(p\) = `r summary(manovaModel, test = 'Wilks') %>% pluck(., 'stats') %>% .[1, 'Pr(>F)']`;
Hotelling-Lawley's trace =
`r summary(manovaModel, test = 'Hotelling-Lawley') %>% pluck(., 'stats') %>% .[1, 'Hotelling-Lawley']`,
\(p\) = `r summary(manovaModel, test = 'Hotelling-Lawley') %>% pluck(., 'stats') %>% .[1, 'Pr(>F)']`;
Roy's largest root =
`r summary(manovaModel, test = 'Roy') %>% pluck(., 'stats') %>% .[1, 'Roy']`,
\(p\) = `r summary(manovaModel, test = 'Roy') %>% pluck(., 'stats') %>% .[1, 'Pr(>F)']`).
The effect size, calculated as
\(\omega^2_{mult}\) = `r summary(manovaModel, test = 'Wilks') -> .;
omegaSquared(nrow(manovaModel$residuals), .$stats[1, 'Wilks'], .$stats[1, 'Df'])`.
To further inspect the relationship of the interpolated activities with our
dependent variables, we have conducted a Roy-Bargmann stepdown analysis, as
suggested by \citeauthor{tabachnick_using_2012} (\citeyear{tabachnick_using_2012};
a linear discriminant analysis with the same aim is available in the supplementary
materials). The total number of correct answers was a priori chosen to be the
higher priority variable. Therefore, we first conducted an ANOVA with interpolated
activity type as the indepedent variable and the total number of correct answers
as the dependent variable.

```{r royBargmann1}
# anova
anovaRB <- aov(totalCorrect ~ activityFactor, datHardNofeed)
anovaRB %<>% Anova(.) %>% broom::tidy(.)

# ancova with totalCorrect as covariate
ancovaRB <- aov(totalIntrusors ~ totalCorrect + activityFactor, datHardNofeed)
ancovaRB %>% Anova(., type = '3') %>% broom::tidy(.) -> .

effect('activityFactor', ancovaRB, se = T) %>% summary(.)
```

As could be expected, the ANOVA points to an interpolated activity effect, with
\(F(`r anovaRB %>% filter(., term == 'activityFactor') %>% pull(., df)`,
`r anovaRB %>% filter(., term == 'Residuals') %>% pull(., df)`)\) =
`r anovaRB %>% select(., statistic) %>% slice(1)`,
\(p\) = `r anovaRB %>% select(., p.value) %>% slice(1)`.
Following the ANOVA, we conducted an ANCOVA, with
the total number of correct answers as the covariate, and the total number of intrusors
as the dependent variable. As could be expected, the results imply a main effect
of the total number of correct answers
(\(F(`r (.) %>% filter(., term == 'totalCorrect') %>% pull(df)`,
`r (.) %>% filter(., term == 'Residuals') %>% pull(df)`)\) =
`r (.) %>% filter(., term == 'totalCorrect') %>% pull(statistic)`,
\(p = `r (.) %>% filter(., term == 'totalCorrect') %>% pull(p.value)`\)).
After correcting for the number of correct
answers, there is no evidence for an effect of interpolated activity on the total
number of chosen intrusors
(\(F (`r (.) %>% filter(., term == 'activityFactor') %>% pull(df)`,
`r (.) %>% filter(., term == 'Residuals') %>% pull(df)`)\) =
`r (.) %>% filter(., term == 'activityFactor') %>% pull(statistic)`,
\(p\) = `r (.) %>% filter(., term == 'activityFactor') %>% pull(p.value)`).
For now, we may claim that we do not have any evidence to support our second hypothesis
that the type of interpolated activity will have an effect on the number of
intrusors.

```{r contrastsH1}
contrastMatrix <- matrix(c(1, 1, -2, 1, -1, 0), 3, 2)
colnames(contrastMatrix) <- c('test vs rereading', 'content vs general')

anovaContrastH1 <- aov(totalCorrect ~ activityFactor, datHardNofeed,
                       contrasts = list(activityFactor = contrastMatrix))
anovaContrastH1 %>% summary.lm(.) %>% broom::tidy(.) -> .

esCont1 <- tes((.) %>% select(., statistic) %>% slice(2) %>% as.integer(.),
               datHardNofeed %>% tally(., activityFactor == 'rereading') %>%
                 as.integer(.),
               datHardNofeed %>% tally(., activityFactor != 'rereading') %>%
                 as.integer(.))

esCont2 <- tes((.) %>% select(., statistic) %>% slice(3) %>% as.integer(.),
               datHardNofeed %>% tally(., activityFactor == 'rereading') %>%
                 as.integer(.),
               datHardNofeed %>% tally(., activityFactor != 'rereading') %>%
                 as.integer(.))

```

In order to test our first hypothesis, we have contrasted
(i) the rereading group with the two test groups, and (ii) the two test groups with
each other, taking only the total number of correct answers as the DV.
The first contrast finds no evidence of a difference between the rereading group
and the two test groups
(\(t\) = `r (.) %>% select(statistic) %>% slice(2)`,
\(p\) = `r (.) %>% select(p.value) %>% slice(2)`,
\(g_s\) = `r esCont1$g`, 95% CI = [`r esCont1$l.g`, `r esCont1$u.g`],
Cohens's \(U_{3, g_s}\) = `r esCont1$U3.g`%,
probability of superiority = `r esCont1$cl.g`%).
However, there is a difference between the two test groups
(\(t\) = `r (.) %>% select(statistic) %>% slice(3)`,
\(p\) = `r (.) %>% select(p.value) %>% slice(3)`).

### The interaction between feedback and interpolated activity type

```{r datHardFeedFilter}
datHardFeed <- datHard %>% filter(., activityFactor != 'rereading') %>%
  select(., activityFactor, totalCorrect, totalIntrusors)
```

The remaining hypotheses deal with the effect of feedback on the total number of
correct answers and the total number of intrusors. Therefore, these analyses are
carried out only on the data from participants in the general and content related
test conditions (\(n\) = `r nrow(datHard)`). To test these hypotheses, we first
conducted a two-way MANOVA with interpolated activity and feedback as independent
variables, and total number of correct answers and total number of intrusors as
the dependent variables.
