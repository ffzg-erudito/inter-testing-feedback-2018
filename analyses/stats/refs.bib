	abstract = {Two experiments, theoretically motivated by the construction‐integration model of comprehension (W. Kintsch, 1988), investigated effects of prior knowledge on learning from high‐ and low‐coherence history texts. In Experiment 1, participants’ comprehension was examined through free recall, multiple‐choice questions, and a keyword sorting task. An advantage was found for the high‐coherence text on recall and multiple‐choice questions. However, high‐knowledge readers performed better on the sorting task after reading the low‐coherence text. In Experiment 2, participants’ comprehension was examined through open‐ended questions and the sorting task both immediately and after a 1‐week delay. Little effect of delay was found, and the previous sorting task results failed to replicate. As predicted, high‐knowledge readers performed better on the open‐ended questions after reading the low‐coherence text. Reading times from both experiments indicated that the low‐coherence text requires more inference processes. These inferences are more likely to be successful and useful for high‐knowledge readers.},

	abstract = {This chapter examines the way inferences are related to the retention of information contained in instructional text. When natural instructional texts are written so that the reader must make many inferences to link different parts of the texts, the texts are retained poorly. This is probably because many of the readers fail to make the inferences. Because those readers do not link some parts of the text; therefore, they are unable to retrieve the information from those parts. When revised versions of the original natural texts remove the call to make inferences, the revised versions are retained significantly better than the originals. High-quality objects are constructed by experts who use imagination and judgment. The chapter describes the creation of an expertise-based theory of learnable instructional text. The expert writers of instructional text typically begin with an information base, often in the form of an original version. The inferences are defined algorithmically by a computer program using Kintsch's propositionalization concepts. According to this, there are two types of inferences: (1) inferences requiring prior knowledge from outside the text and (2) inferences requiring prior knowledge from earlier in the text that had not been kept in mind.},

	abstract = {Across the social sciences, researchers have overwhelmingly used the classical statistical paradigm to draw conclusions from data, often focusing heavily on a single number: p. Recent years, however, have witnessed a surge of interest in an alternative statistical paradigm: Bayesian inference, in which probabilities are attached to parameters and models. We feel it is informative to provide statistical conclusions that go beyond a single number, and—regardless of one’s statistical preference—it can be prudent to report the results from both the classical and the Bayesian paradigms. In order to promote a more inclusive and insightful approach to statistical inference, we show how the Summary Stats module in the open-source software program JASP (https://jasp-stats.org) can provide comprehensive Bayesian reanalyses from just a few commonly reported summary statistics, such as t and N. These Bayesian reanalyses allow researchers—and also editors, reviewers, readers, and reporters—to (a) quantify evidence on a continuous scale using Bayes factors, (b) assess the robustness of that evidence to changes in the prior distribution, and (c) gauge which posterior parameter ranges are more credible than others by examining the posterior distribution of the effect size. The procedure is illustrated using Festinger and Carlsmith’s (1959) seminal study on cognitive dissonance.},

It refers to the internal validity of a study and is described more precisely as assessing the risk of bias. Potential biases derive from selection of participants, data collection, analysis and selective reporting of study results. Quality assessment tools systematically collect information about study characteristics that may lead to bias in order to estimate the overall risk of bias. There are numerous tools available; they can be classified into checklists, scales and component ratings. Focusing on tools for assessing randomized controlled studies, an overview of covered elements of six selected generic tools is given. The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool is described in more detail because it incorporates some important features. Practical aspects of conducting quality assessments are discussed including the meaning and importance of detailed and precise guidance.},

	abstract = {Empirical studies in psychology commonly report Cronbach’s alpha as a measure of internal consistency reliability despite the fact that many methodological studies have shown that Cronbach’s alpha is riddled with problems stemming from unrealistic assumptions. In many circumstances, violating these assumptions yields estimates of reliability that are too small, making measures look less reliable than they actually are. Although methodological critiques of Cronbach’s alpha are being cited with increasing frequency in empirical studies, in this tutorial we discuss how the trend is not necessarily improving methodology used in the literature. That is, many studies continue to use Cronbach’s alpha without regard for its assumptions or merely cite methodological articles advising against its use to rationalize unfavorable Cronbach’s alpha estimates. This tutorial first provides evidence that recommendations against Cronbach’s alpha have not appreciably changed how empirical studies report reliability. Then, we summarize the drawbacks of Cronbach’s alpha conceptually without relying on mathematical or simulation-based arguments so that these arguments are accessible to a broad audience. We continue by discussing several alternative measures that make less rigid assumptions which provide justifiably higher estimates of reliability compared to Cronbach’s alpha. We conclude with empirical examples to illustrate advantages of alternative measures of reliability including omega total, Revelle’s omega total, the greatest lower bound, and Coefficient H. A detailed software appendix is also provided to help researchers implement alternative methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Accordingly, this study asked young and older adults to write short essays on three topics thought to vary in the degree of difficulty needed to complete each task: (1) a descriptive report, (2) a report containing generalized comparisons, and (3) a report containing persuasive arguments. It was thought that the use of these three types of writing assignments would allow for an examination of the manner in which age affects the various linguistic skills necessary to complete writing tasks of varying degrees of difficulty. Analyses of the lexical features of the texts (e.g., passage length, word frequency, etc.) revealed that there were few differences between the texts produced by either age group in any of the writing conditions. Syntactic (e.g., number of correctly produced verbs and sentences) and structural (eg., degree of cohesion in the text) differences in the texts were also examined. In general, it was found that there were few age differences in the syntax used by either age group, but older adults produced texts that were less cohesive than those of younger adults. There were, however, considerable semantic differences (i.e., differences in the topics of the sentences used in the texts) found in the passages produced by the young and older adults. In general, the sentences produced by older adults tended to include more references to concrete objects, whereas the sentences produced by younger adults made greater use of generalized themes and abstract topics. The texts produced by the two age groups were also analyzed in terms of individual differences in the cognitive skills and life circumstances of the participants. It was found that individual differences in both educational level and working memory seemed to be primarily responsible for the differences in the writing styles of young and older adults.},

The global, causal inferences occurred where anticipated by the discourse analysis. The talk-aloud data also revealed that subjects used four main mental operations during comprehension of a text sentence: maintaining, retrieving, elaborating, and explaining. Third, the talk-aloud data predicted recognition priming of superordinate goal statements, reading times of sentences, coherence ratings of stories, and long-term retention of stories.

Based on the argument that metadiscourse markers help transform a dry and tortuous piece of text into coherent and reader-friendly prose, the researchers in the current study attempted to investigate the effect different metadiscourse markers might have on Iranian EFL learners' perception of written texts. To this end, 120 undergraduate English students were given three different texts chosen from the most common textbooks in BA ( in TEFL), along with their doctored versions ( all MD-removed, interactive-removed, and interactional-removed). Each text duo was then accompanied by an 8-item questionnaire adopted from Ifantido (2005). The statistical analysis of the data pointed toward the positive role of metadiscourse markers in bringing about ameliorated text perception on the part of EFL learners. Furthermore, the comparison of the results gained in each separate phase of the study, processed through the application of ANOVA and LSD tests, revealed that texts with both interactive and interactional resources had more effect on learners' perception of written texts. Moreover, it was found that interactive and interactional resources had more or less the same effect on learners' reactions to texts. To summarize, in line with the findings of the present study further evidence is gathered in favor of the argument holding that metadiscourse markers bring about an increased amount of coherence and reader-friendliness in texts.},

After the discussion phase, students revised their files and answered a questionnaire about their perception of the value of this practice for language learning. Regarding the production of presentation files, most aspects of the title slide and overall slide designs were performed well, except for a lack of dynamic effects and inadequate consideration of the visual perception of the audience. Peer group discussion and the scoring can assist the students in inspiring their creativity and modification of the designs of their presentations. In contrast, other aspects such as language use were not improved, probably due to the limited language proficiency of the students or their unawareness of the need for further improvement. The questionnaire results indicate that students appreciated peer group discussions and understood that they might need increased skills to use the presentation software in a more sophisticated way.},

Characteristic demands of concept mapping include connecting lines representing the relationships between concepts and labeling these lines, specifying the type of the semantic relationships. In the first experiment, employing a within-subjects design, 20 psychology students completed a label-provided-lines economics mapping task and then a create-and-label-lines meteorology mapping task or vice versa. The analysis of 40 think-aloud protocols indicated more elaboration processes for the label-provided-lines task than for the create-and-label-lines task. On the other hand, the protocols indicated more model-construction and organization processes in the create-and-label-lines task. The second experiment used the same variation but focused on learning outcomes and perceived self-efficacy as dependent measures. Forty-two psychology students were randomly assigned to either a label-provided-lines mapping task or a create-and-label-lines mapping task. Subsequently, both groups completed a learning phase in a hypertext environment and a posttest. Results showed substantial differences in learning outcomes and perceived self-efficacy in favor of the label-provided-lines prior knowledge activation task. The findings are congruent with coherence effects found in text-comprehension research and support the position that concept mapping should not be seen as a unitary method but be differentiated according to the specific tasks to be completed.},

In Experiment 1, participants read passages that contained an elaboration section that was either consistent or qualified (inconsistent but then corrected to be consistent) with respect to the subsequently presented target sentence (see O'Brien et al., 1998). However, the experiment used two target sentences, and several filler sentences were inserted between the first and second target sentence. The results showed that the reading times for the first target sentence in the qualified elaboration version were significantly longer than those in the consistent elaboration version. These were consistent with O'Brien's study, and further indicated that the basic process captured by the memory-based view appears to generalize to the Chinese reader better than does the here-and-now view. More importantly, the results showed that the reading times for the second target sentence in the qualified elaboration version were as long as those in the consistent elaboration version. These further indicated that the activation of background information not only maintained the coherence of the text, but also allowed for the relevant information to be updated, resulting in a unified information set. When the information was reactivated during ongoing reading, it would be in the form of unified information. In Experiment 2, the first target sentence in each passage from Experiment 1 was converted to a filler sentence, and the second target sentence became the target sentence. The results of Experiment 2 showed that the reading times for the target sentence in the qualified elaboration version were significantly longer than those for the consistent elaboration version. These indicated that the delay between the target sentences and the elaboration section was not responsible for the lack of differences in Experiment 1, and confirmed the conclusion of Experiment 1.},

Results from 2 studies revealed that readers with low prior knowledge base their decisions on what to read next on a default screen position or on link interest more often if they are instructed to set a low learning goal, if they regularly use shallow learning strategies (e.g., memorizing), or if they are poor at calibrating their comprehension. Readers' link selection strategies mediated the effect of the self-regulation variables studied on comprehension.},

Participants were provided with a computer-based material on plate tectonics and then with explanatory support in the form of either a tailored explanation preceded by an impasse-trigger (I + E group) or an identical explanation without the impasse-trigger (noI + E group). After the reading of the materials they solved retention and transfer tests; their flawed ideas were also counted. Participants in the I + E group recalled more correct information, generated more transfer solutions, and showed fewer flawed ideas than those in the noI + E group.

Unfortunately, this endeavor is hamstrung by a lack of empirical research on the topic. Research conducted in my laboratory and others has provided some insight, however. It is now understood that several system and user characteristics influence outcomes of hypermedia-assisted learning (HAL). Among the most relevant factors are learners' levels of metacognition and prior knowledge, and the interaction between these factors and hypermedia structure. By capitalizing on this research, it is possible to create hypermedia that scaffolds learners in their quest to build knowledge and understanding. The present article draws from empirical findings to suggest hypemedia design strategies aimed at scaffolding learners engaged in HAL. These guidelines target learners' knowledge and metacognitive ability to structure hypermedia that maximizes learning potential.},

Significant results involving structured questioning techniques (i.e., signal words and generic question stems) were detected primarily through interaction effects and one main effect. While not always significantly superior, generic question stem participants outperformed their signal word and unguided questioning counterparts on the majority of text memory and text learning variables.},

The experiments show that objective marking is more persuasive than subjective marking. Also, subjective marking causes readers to recognize the persuasive author's intent more easily. Furthermore, subjective markers seem to cause resistance to persuasion, whereas objective markers improve integration of information.},

We examined whether AS also affects retention when, as in interpreting, coherent text is to be remembered or meaningful and phonologically more complex material is articulated. In the first part of the study, participants listened to a set of stories, and were involved in traditional or complex AS. Also coherence of the texts was manipulated. We found that the effects of AS generalises to stories, that coherence influences recall and that both variables interact. In the second part, we related individual differences in retention under conditions of AS to simultaneous interpreting performance.

This vector is attracted by the centers of gravity, while also being affected by context information and world knowledge. When the vector reaches one of the centers of gravity, the ambiguity is resolved to the corresponding interpretation. The model accounts for reading time and error rate data from experiments on ambiguous pronoun resolution and explains the effects of context informativeness, anaphor type, and processing depth. It shows how implicit causality can have an early effect during reading. A novel prediction is that ambiguities can remain unresolved if there is insufficient disambiguating information.},

Furthermore, different types of material (e.g. text or diagrams) influence learners' self-explanation behaviour. This study explores whether the coherence of text impacts upon the self-explanation effect. Forty-eight low-knowledge learners (university students) learnt about the circulatory system with text that was designed to be either maximally or minimally coherent. Half of these learners also received self-explanation training. Results showed that learners given maximally coherent text learnt more, as did learners who self-explained. However, this was not because coherent text increased self-explaining. Instead minimally coherent text significantly increased the number of self-explanations that learners made. It is suggested that self-explaining in the minimal text condition served to compensate for weaknesses and gaps in the text, whereas self-explaining in the maximal text condition may have led learners to detect flaws in their mental models and repair them. Consequently, rather than providing a minimally coherent text which compels low knowledge learners to self-explain to overcome its deficits, we should instead encourage learners to self-explain from well structured and explicit text.

	abstract = {The current electronic text format is inherent to the problem of text integration, or, alternatively, cohesion deficit, which greatly affects reading comprehension. The question remains as to whether well structured hypertext would enable L2 readers, particularly ESL readers, to overcome potential difficulties in integrating information and building a unified representation of text content delivered by computer. This study examines the efficacy of embedding microstructural devices (e.g., headings, reviews, and logical connectives statements) and macrostructural devices (a graphical overview map of text content) on the construction and organization of computer hypertext presentations. The study also investigates the interaction between the effect of L2 readers' reading proficiency and the degree of structure in hypertext (structured vs. less structured) on ESL learners' development of coherent mental representations of hypertext content. The participants, 40 ESL students, were introduced to two hypertext reading programs. The first was considered well structured hypertext because it included organizational devices and explicitly showed its underlying hypertext structure. The second was considered less structured because it included no organizational devices and did not indicate the underlying structure of its hypertext. A repeated measures design was used in this study. Forty participants were measured under two conditions: well structured and less structured hypertexts. They were identified as intermediate ESL learners based on their TOEFL scores and were classified as proficient or less proficient readers based on their scores on the reading section of the TOEFL. To assess the efficacy of each type of hypertext, multiple choice and mapping main ideas and details tests were developed and administered to participants after they had read both hypertexts. Results of both tests were analyzed using a paired-samples t-test to compare performance in the two hypertext reading programs and a two-way (proficiency level by hypertext reading program) mixed model ANOVA. The investigation yielded findings showing that well structured hypertext aided ESL readers in developing a more coherent mental representation of the hypertext content, thereby increasing their reading comprehension. The results also indicated that well structured hypertext was more helpful to less proficient readers than it was to more proficient readers. These results offer theoretical, pedagogical, and technological implications for L2 reading instructors and instructional designers.},

For low-knowledge readers, the coherence strategy supported better learning of the content. This effect seems to rely on the improvement of reading order coherence induced by this strategy. By contrast, for intermediate-knowledge readers the coherence and the interest strategies benefited comprehension equally. In both cases, learning was supported through the active processing induced by these strategies.

In particular, the article theorizes that forming an accurate mental representation of the text content of ads is essential for comprehension and can influence evaluations. Two conditions must be met in order to form a mental representation: referential continuity and coherence. A text possesses referential continuity if each of its parts refers, implicitly or explicitly, to an entity introduced in the previous part. A text is coherent if individuals can readily integrate its parts. Four empirical studies suggest that the repetition of certain verbal and pictorial cues can help provide referential continuity and that an ad's structure, or presentation format, can facilitate coherence but only when referential continuity is established.},

In this article we explore a possible factor affecting this situation, mainly the fact that previous works did not control for the potential effects on comprehension of reading strategies in hypertext. In Experiment 1, results showed that reading strategies selectively affect the textbase and the situation model level. The number of different nodes read mainly affected the textbase, whereas the reading order influenced the situation model. In Experiment 2, the analysis of reading strategies replicated the effect of knowledge and coherence found in the literature on linear text comprehension (McNamara \& Kintsch, 1996), but it was not replicated in hypertext. Low-knowledge participants learned more by following a high coherent reading order, whereas high-knowledge participants learned more by reading the hypertext in a low-coherence order. We discuss the theoretical and methodological consequences of this approach for the study of hypertext comprehension.},

We propose that such metacognitive judgments are based on the content of working memory at the exact moment of assessment. Generally speaking, this working metacognition hypothesis is in agreement with Koriat's cue utilization approach, which implies that different elements of information will be available (and used) depending on the moment at which a judgment is made. More specifically, our hypothesis focuses on the management of working memory during reading as a cause for cue (un)availability. In support of these views, the results of Experiment 1 showed that a cohesion manipulation affecting the comprehension of specific paragraphs influences judgments only on these paragraphs, and not on judgments on the whole text. In Experiment 2, we showed that an interfering task that takes place just before this paragraph judgment is made wipes out this cohesion effect. Experiment 3 showed, on the other hand, that the whole-text judgment may, nevertheless, be affected by text cohesion, provided that the readers keep an access to the text when the judgment is made. These results support the idea that working memory management makes different cues available for metacognitive ratings at different delays.},

Among older (but not younger) readers, domain knowledge increased the time allocated to organization and integration processes (wrap-up) and increased the frequency of knowledge-based inferences during recall.

To make the training more widely available, the Web-based trainer has been developed. Transforming the training from a human-delivered application to a computer-based one has resulted in a highly interactive trainer that adapts its methods to the performance of the students. The iSTART trainer introduces the strategies in a simulated classroom setting with interaction between three animated characters-an instructor character and two student characters-and the human trainee. Thereafter, the trainee identifies the strategies in the explanations of a student character who is guided by an instructor character. Finally, the trainee practices self-explanation under the guidance of an instructor character. We describe this system and discuss how appropriate feedback is generated.},

Half of the participants (n = 42) received SERT, which included reading strategy instruction and self-explanation practice with 4 science texts (SERT condition). The remaining participants read aloud the 4 science texts (control condition). During this training phase, self-explanation, as compared to reading aloud, only improved comprehension for the most difficult of the 4 texts. Prior domain knowledge consistently improved comprehension performance, whereas reading skill and reading span had minimal effects. After training, both SERT and control participants self-explained a difficult text about cell mitosis. SERT improved comprehension and self-explanation quality only for participants with low domain knowledge. However, the effects of SERT on low-knowledge participants' comprehension emerged only for text-based questions and not for bridging- inference questions. Protocol analyses indicated that SERT helped these participants to use logic, or domain-general knowledge, rather than domain-specific knowledge to make sense of the text.},

This finding suggests that not all readers are scrupulous about processing and integrating every word into their mental representation of the text, and will often assume coherence as a default, as long as there is sufficient global coherence. However, it was only the less-skilled readers who had particular difficulty noticing locally anomalous NPs such as tranquilizing stimulants, suggesting that less-skilled readers frequently fail to compute the local meaning of a NP prior to integrating it into the more global representation of the text.},

Results for college students revealed a grouping effect. Processing multiple propositions together generated more accurate mappings than did processing individual propositions, but only when propositions that jointly provided strong structural constraints were grouped together. Other experiments revealed asymmetries in mapping and inference accuracy: mappings and inferences generated from a more coherent analog to a less coherent analog were more accurate than those made in the reverse direction.

The study reported here is intended to demonstrate that the quality of the text produced by educated adults falls when production is performed in the written rather than in the spoken mode, but only when the elements on the basis of which the texts are to be produced are difficult to relate to one another. In this view, we compared performance in a text production span task in either the oral or the written mode. This task consisted of presenting sets of words, semantically linked or not, from which adults had to produce texts including the words in the set. The results showed that neither the production mode nor the extent of the relationship between the items influenced the number of words recalled. By contrast, the number of ideas elaborated and the coherence of the produced texts are lower when the supplied items are difficult to link and when production is in the written mode. These results are interpreted in the framework of capacity theories in production. They suggest that the cost of managing written production is not always negligible in well-educated adults. When they have to produce texts on the basis of provided elements that are only weakly associated with one another in the written mode, the residual capacity necessary either to maintain and organise the information in working memory, or to adopt a strategic approach to the composition of the texts, is insufficient because the cost of this elaboration must be added to that of the management of the written production.},

In Experiment 1, writers composed short continuations at various points throughout a simple narrative, whereas in Experiment 2, writers composed continuations to complete several narratives. The results indicate that causality indeed plays a major role in composition. Writers tend to produce new text in such a way that it is causally connected to the prior text.

Elaborations involved connections to prior knowledge as well as other text information (both within and across texts) and often-represented self-explanations. The complexity of reasoning about the historical event was predicted by think-aloud comments that increased the coherence of the texts: self-explanations that used prior knowledge or previously processed text information as well as surface text connections.

To evaluate the LTM representations of text ideas, we used the extended process-dissociation procedure (Buchner, Erdfelder, \& Vaterrodt-Plunnecke, 1995; Jacoby, 1991) to partition the controlled, recollective contributions to text retrieval from the automatic, familiarity-based contributions. The automatic contribution to the recognition of implied concepts was consistently negligible, an outcome consistent with the absence of perceptual processing of those concepts during the original reading. In addition, the controlled basis of recognition was consistently higher for explicit than for implicit concepts, which suggests a more robust conceptual representation for explicit text ideas (Yonelinas, 2002). These results were interpreted to reflect the asymmetric representation of explicit ideas and inferences (elaborative and even bridging inferences) in the surface, propositional textbase, and situational levels of text representation.},

Both groups of comprehenders read inconsistent actions more slowly than consistent actions in the local coherence condition, but only good comprehenders showed die reading time difference in the global coherence condition. In Experiment 2, the authors disconfirmed the hypothesis that poor comprehenders fail to maintain global coherence because they fail to activate prior text information. Thus, the results present a paradoxical picture in which poor readers activate relevant knowledge during reading but fail to integrate it into their developing representation.},

Making already concrete text more emotionally interesting may have little effect. Using a coherent text structure that adequately implies or signals importance and supporting important information with concrete explanation are key text design implications.

The other model views bridges as the result of a form of deduction in which the render tacitly establishes premises that provide rational support for the bridging inferences. Students were timed as they read pairs of sentences, half of which were related by a signal to cohesion. Following each sentence pair, students verified a statement that probed verbatim recall or inference from the sentence pair. Readers' responses to probe statements were consistent with having supplied an unstated premise in addition to the inferential bridge when reading sentences that contained a signal to cohesion but not when reading unsignaled sentences. These response measures correlate with a distinctive pattern of students' regressive eye fixations while reading sentences with signals to cohesion.

Contrasting these analysis styles discloses a range of information assumed by the distinct approaches. We organize this information according to principles of linguistic ''stratification,'' ''metafunction,'' and ''paradigmatic/syntagmatic axiality'' in order to provide a bi-stratal, three-way classification system from which individual discourse structure relations can be motivated. This provides a more effective decomposition of the space of ''discourse structure information'' which at the same time synthesizes most previous views. We illustrate some of the benefits of the specification for linguistic analysis and point out problematic areas for future formal and computational specification.},

Kintsch, Songer \& W. Kintsch, in press; McNamara \& W. Kintsch, in preparation). The effects obtained in these studies may be attributed to the fact that a fully explicit text induces in high-knowledge readers an illusory feeling of knowing. In consequence, these readers do not process the text at a deep enough level to ensure learning. This hypothesis is rested in an experiment in which readers are asked to comment on their understanding after every sentence of a text, thereby forcing all readers to be more active processors. It is shown that under these circumstances both high- and low-knowledge readers learn best with a high-coherence text.

First, the definition of minimalism is flawed with reference to the concepts of automaticity and the two minimalist criteria. Second, minimalism is difficult to falsify. Third, the minimalist prediction that readers will not inferentially link distant text ideas under local coherence is contradicted by existing evidence. Fourth, the minimalist denial that readers routinely derive situation models from text is not a necessary implication of the minimalist hypothesis. An alternate, global, analysis is that readers maintain coherence at multiple levels of test representation, including the situational level; and that inference processes are guided by the collaboration of availability, convergence of activation, and the search for explanations for text outcomes.

The set of relations proposed in Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann \& Thompson, 1987) has had particular influence in both of these fields. But the widespread adoption of ''relational'' terminology belies a certain amount of confusion about the relational constructs themselves: No two theorists use exactly the same set of relations, and often there seems no motivation for introducing a new relation beyond considerations of descriptive adequacy or engineering expedience. To alleviate this confusion, it is useful to think of relations not just as constructs with descriptive or operational utility, but as constructs with psychological reality, modelling real cognitive processes in readers and writers. This conception of coherence relations suggests a methodology for delineating a set of relations to work with. Evidence that a relation is actually used by speakers of a language can be obtained by looking at the language itself-in particular by looking at the range of cue phrases the language provides for signalling relations. It is to be expected that simple methods will have evolved for signalling the relations we find most useful. This article presents a bottom-up methodology for determining a set of relations on the basis of the cue phrases that can be used to mark them in text. This methodology has the advantage of starting from concrete linguistic data, rather than from controversial assumptions about notions like ''intention'' and ''semantics.''},

While the technology has been successful in correlating with the qualitative ratings of human experts, it is unclear what aspect of knowledge is being reflected in an LSA output. The two experiments presented here were designed to address this general question. We were particularly interested in whether an LSA analysis more accurately reflects the factual or conceptual knowledge contained in written material. Experiment 1 explored this issue by comparing LSA analyses of essays to human-generated scores. It also compared the LSA output to several measures of conceptual structure. Experiment 2 correlated LSA analyses of transcribed recall protocols with a series of comprehension measures that were designed to vary in the degree to which they reflect conceptual or factual knowledge. We found compelling evidence that LSA analyses are a stronger reflection of the text-based knowledge represented by essays and recall protocols than conceptual knowledge. Both studies also explored a methodological issue pertaining to the use of LSA. Specifically, does LSA have to be "trained" in the particular content area of the text to be analyzed? This question was addressed by running multiple LSA analyses, each performed with differing "semantic spaces" created through training in domain specific or general content areas. We found that LSA performed best when trained in a content area specific to the material to be analyzed.

In an experiment using reading, verification, and free recall tasks, 2 crucial aspects of the structure of expository texts were investigated: the type of coherence relation between segments (problem-solution vs, list) and the linguistic marking of the relations by means of signaling phrases (implicit vs, explicit). Both factors affected text processing. Problem solution relations lead to faster processing, better verification, and superior recall. Explicit marking of the relations resulted in faster processing but did not affect recall. We conclude that the processing of a text segment depends on the relation it has with preceding segments. The relational marker has an effect during online processing, but its influence decreases over time. This contrasts with the effect of the coherence relation, which is also manifest in the recall.},

Previous work found that sentence material set in a coherent, ordered text context was not judged as more memorable than that presented in a context of sentences in a disordered sequence, even though an ordered sequence helped recall (Shaddock \& Carroll, 1997). The current study modified Shaddock and Carroll's design by changing the texts used from expository to narrative text. The metamemory judgements and recall were now found to be significantly more sensitive to material learned in an ordered sequence than to material learned in a disordered sequence. Also, JOLs and recall were more sensitive to material that was originally learned in an auditory mode (spoken presentation) than in a visual mode (verbal presentation). The results are discussed in terms of a cue-utilisation approach to metamemory judgements.},

The direct self-evaluation task was carried out with consistent texts in which target anaphors were either repeated noun phrases or pronouns. Subjects had to read and to evaluate their own comprehension on a 6-point scale. After reading, subjects answered multiple-choice questions designed to test the processing of anaphors. In the inconsistency detection task, target anaphors were either repeated noun phrases or inconsistent noun phrases. Subjects had to read and detect inconsistencies. After reading, they answered multiple-choice questions. In both tasks, on-line measures (reading times for units containing target anaphors and for subsequent units, and look-backs) were collected in addition to off-line measures (ratings of comprehension, detection of inconsistencies and response to multiple-choice questions) in order to analyse indicators of implicit and explicit evaluation and revision activities. The results from the two tasks converged: less skilled comprehenders showed deficiencies in monitoring on measures of implicit and explicit evaluation and revision. Patterns of reading times revealed that less skilled comprehenders were sensitive to the difficulties in processing pronouns in the self-evaluation task and also sensitive to the lack of text cohesion in the inconsistency detection task. However, this sensitivity was weak and unable to trigger explicit activities. These results were interpreted in the framework of Karmiloff-Smith's (1986) model.},

Participants read well-structured stories in which the coherence marking in the target sentence was either congruent or incongruent with the discourse, or they read randomized lists of sentences drawn from the stories, in which the target sentence appeared in the same serial position. In all conditions, the local environment was held constant. Results from some of the stories indicated that there was a facilitation in reading time for congruent text marking for both cohesion and textual structure. However, this Facilitation effect manifested itself at different points in the sentence: at the end of the sentence for congruent pronominalization. and within the sentence for congruent topicalization. A slight modification of the original hypothesis can account for the stories that did not show this pattern of results. These results strongly suggest that: (I) readers are highly sensitive to coherence marking devices; and (2) strictly local coherence models cannot completely account for what readers are doing as they read well-structured discourses. These findings are consistent with models of discourse processing that assume that readers are using coherence marking in the text to help them construct a semantic representation of the discourse.},

Participants read sentence pairs varying in degree of causal relatedness and recalled one sentence of each pair when the other was given as a cue 24 hours later. When they generated an elaboration for each pair, recall was better than when they studied the pair for memorization. Recall as a function of degree of causal relatedness differed between the two encoding conditions. In the study condition, highly related sentences were generally recalled better than less related sentences. In the elaboration condition, recall for minimally related pairs was better than that for moderately related pairs and as good as that for highly related pairs. The results suggest that integration and elaboration had a critical effect on L2 readers' comprehension and memory of the sentences.

This instructional intervention approach, aimed at directly improving reading ability, can be used in combination with text simplification. Text simplification is the modification of the text in order to make it more understandable or readable for target groups of readers. In this article, we discuss a theoretically-driven text simplification approach, inspired by cognitive models of reading comprehension. Differently from classical approaches to linguistic text simplification, the aim of cognitive text simplification is not simply to reduce the linguistic complexity of the text, but to improve text coherence and the structure of information in the text. This can be achieved by using rhetorical devices, like signaling or discourse markers, which specify relationships among ideas at a global level (macrostructural) and work as processing instructions for the reader, scaffolding reading comprehension. The goal of this paper is to discuss, in light of the literature, the effectiveness of these adaptations for improving struggling readers' understanding and learning from informational texts.},

	abstract = {This paper comprises two parts. First, it reports on native-speaker English lecturers' envisaged reactions to and evaluation of Italian EFL graduate students' written discourse (41 written offers and 17 written requests). Participants were asked to comment on the texts' perceived positive and negative traits (e.g. (im)plausibility, (un) naturalness); to rate them along several dimensions (e.g. structure, amount of content); and to envisage their possible immediate and delayed effects. The teachers' comments on and anticipated reactions to the student discourse revealed the importance they attributed to the learners' awareness of interactants' interpersonal needs and social rights, suggesting that perceptions of pragmatic norms may serve to explore language learners' interactional competence. Instead, the teachers' ratings expressed technical evaluations of the strengths and weaknesses (e.g. (in) coherence, register (in) appropriateness) of the texts, highlighting areas for focused instruction. In the second part, the lecturers' responses indicated that they considered it useful and suitable to alert learners to the interpersonal-social consequences of linguistic-interactional choices. The findings suggest that foreign language learning could be enhanced through the provision of complementary forms of assessment: a projection of the envisaged reactions of a "model" interlocutor (socially oriented feedback) with a technical description of standard parameters of "communicative adequacy" (formal evaluation).

The implication for school textbooks is that reading complexity should differ systematically between grade levels and between higher and lower tracks in line with what can be called the systematic complexification assumption. However, research has yet to test this hypothesis with a real-world sample of textbooks. In the present study, we used automatic measures from computational linguistic research to analyze 2,928 texts from geography textbooks from four publishers in Germany in terms of their reading demands. We measured a wide range of lexical, syntactic, morphological, and cohesion-related features and developed text classification models for predicting the grade level (Grades 5 to 10) and school track (academic vs. vocational) of the texts using these features. We also tested ten linguistic features that are considered to be particularly important for a reader's understanding. The results provided only partial support for systematic complexification. The text classification models showed accuracy rates that were clearly above chance but with considerable room for improvement. Furthermore, there were significant differences across grade levels and school tracks for some of the ten linguistic features. Finally, there were marked differences among publishers. The discussion outlines key components for a systematic research program on the causes and consequences of the lack of systematic complexification in reading materials.},

In this study, we provided participants with a scenario in which they were asked to review a fictitious student's draft containing several cohesion gaps. Additionally, participants received an external representation as feedback to support them during their revisions. We varied the format (concept map versus outline) and the specificity (general versus specific) of the provided external representations. We found that participants with specific concept map representations correctly noticed more cohesion gaps, and perceived less cognitive load during reviewing than participants with the specific outline representation. Students with general external representations showed the lowest performance on the noticing task and the highest amount of cognitive load. However, there were no differences among the external representations regarding the quality of students' revisions. Evidently, specific concept maps can be regarded as a useful scaffold to support students' evaluation processes. However, additional instructional support is needed, particularly for novice writers, to effectively revise expository texts for cohesion.},

To do this, an evaluation instrument was created; this instrument allows measuring the performance on these aspects to be measured in an isolated manner in order to clearly identify the difficulties that students have when writing texts.

Thus, in contrast to many other approaches for analysing conversation that focus essentially on the interaction per se, ICA takes the text as its starting point. Drawing on the concept of text movability and systemic-functional cohesion analyses, the approach combines a reader's perspective and a text perspective to show the participants' reception of the text, and also what and how text content is brought into the conversation and how it is handled. In the paper, ICA is described with regard to its theoretical underpinnings, usage and utility. It is suggested that the approach provides educational researchers with an analytical tool that allows detailed ICAs of text-related classroom discussion.

This study describes the automated evaluation of 104 English as a second language texts through use of the computational tool Coh-Metrix, which was used to generate indices reflecting text cohesion, lexical characteristics, and syntactic complexity. The same texts were then independently evaluated by two experienced human assessors through use of an analytic scoring rubric. The interrelationships between the computer and human generated evaluations of the texts are presented in this paper with a particular focus on the automatically generated indices that were most strongly linked to the human generated measures. A synthesis of these findings is then used to discuss the role that such automated evaluation may have in the teaching and assessment of second language writing.},

Much psychological research demonstrates, however, that individual information processing is biased. This poses the question whether individual biases translate to Wikipedia articles or whether they are prevented by its guidelines. The present research makes use of hindsight bias to examine this question. To this end, we analyzed foresight and hindsight versions of Wikipedia articles regarding a broad variety of events (Study 1). We found the majority of articles not to contain traces of hindsight biascontrary to prior individual research. However, for a particular category of eventsdisasterswe found robust evidence for hindsight bias. In a lab experiment (Study 2), we then examined whether individuals' hindsight bias is translated into articles under controlled conditions and tested whether collaborative writingas present in Wikipediaaffects the resultant bias (vs. individual writing). Finally, we investigated the impact of biased Wikipedia articles on readers (Study 3). As predicted, biased articles elicited a hindsight bias in readers, who had not known of the event previously. Moreover, biased articles also affected individuals who knew about the event already, and who had already developed a hindsight bias: biased articles further increased their hindsight.},

Typically, these accounts are based on a sequential task methodology where an initial task is presented to deplete self-regulatory resources, and carryover effects are then examined on a second outcome task. In the aftermath of high profile replication failures using a popular letter-crossing task as a means of depleting self-regulatory resources and subsequent criticisms of that task, current research into self-control is currently at an impasse. This is largely due to the lack of empirical research that tests explicit assumptions regarding the initial task. One such untested assumption is that for resource depletion to occur, the initial task must first establish an habitual response and then this habitual response must be inhibited, with behavioral inhibition being the causal factor in inducing depletion. This study reports on four experiments exploring performance on a letter-canceling task, where the rules for target identification remained constant but the method of responding differed (Experiment 1) and the coherence of the text was manipulated (Experiments 1-4). Experiment 1 established that habit forming and behavioral inhibition did not produce any performance decrement when the targets were embedded in random letter strings. Experiments 2-4 established that target detection was sensitive to language characteristics and the coherence of the background text, suggesting that participants' automatic reading processes is a key driver of performance in the letter-e task.},

For example, a degraded sentence is perceived to be clearer when the content of the speech signal is provided with matching text (i.e., form-based predictability) before hearing the degraded sentence. Here, we investigate whether sentence-level semantic coherence (i.e., meaning-based predictability), enhances perceptual clarity of degraded sentences, and if so, whether the mechanism is the same as that underlying enhancement by matching text. We also ask whether form- and meaning-based predictability are related to individual differences in cognitive abilities. Twenty participants listened to spoken sentences that were either clear or degraded by noise vocoding and rated the clarity of each item. The sentences had either high or low semantic coherence. Each spoken word was preceded by the homologous printed word (matching text), or by a meaningless letter string (nonmatching text). Cognitive abilities were measured with a working memory test. Results showed that perceptual clarity was significantly enhanced both by matching text and by semantic coherence. Importantly, high coherence enhanced the perceptual clarity of the degraded sentences even when they were preceded by matching text, suggesting that the effects of form- and meaning-based predictions on perceptual clarity are independent and additive. However, when working memory capacity indexed by the Size-Comparison Span Test was controlled for, only form-based predictions enhanced perceptual clarity, and then only at some sound quality levels, suggesting that prediction effects are to a certain extent dependent on cognitive abilities.},

A 4Rs framework of redistribution, recognition, representation and reconciliation was employed to analyse data gathered from: interviews with and classroom observations of teacher educators; focus-group discussions with and a questionnaire completed by pre- and in-service teachers; and analysis of teacher education and school curriculum texts. While teachers expressed a nuanced understanding of the conflict drivers in society and appreciated the significance of education in peacebuilding, they subscribed to assimilationist approaches to social cohesion, which were aligned with curriculum texts and promoted official nation-building agendas. Additionally, teachers saw issues of social cohesion as peripheral to the core academic curriculum. Teachers' identity was integrally linked to their religious affiliations.},

We also explored whether normative age-graded life events form more stable parts of life narratives. In a longitudinal life span study covering up to 3 measurements across 8 years and 6 age groups (N = 164) the stability of important memories and of entire life narratives was measured as the percentage of events and narrative segments which were repeated in later tellings. Stability increased between ages 8 and 24, leveling off in middle adulthood. Beyond age, stability of life narratives was also predicted by proportion of normative age-graded life events and by causal-motivational text coherence in younger participants. Memories of normative developmental and social transitional life events were more stable than other memories. Stability of segments of life narratives exceeded the stability of single most important memories.

The four more or less cohesive texts were introduced as literary texts (part of a story) or as expository texts (newspaper article), although the different genres were only purported and the texts contained both literary and expository passages. Reading comprehension was assessed with multiple-choice-items, semi-open, and open-ended questions. Results demonstrate that global cohesion was profitable for reading comprehension with expository expectations, but not with literary ones. Local text cohesion and both forms of cohesion in combination did not interact with students' genre expectations and had no main effect on comprehension. When students reading skills and prior knowledge were considered, the interaction was still apparent. Moreover, students with lower levels of reading skills tended to profit especially from texts with global cohesion, whereas the readers with higher reading skills achieved equal means in reading comprehension irrespective of the degree of global text cohesion. The findings are discussed with respect to theoretical aspects of text-reader-interactions, cognitive and emotional components of genre expectations, and the composition and instruction of comprehensible school texts.},

	abstract = {Background: New curriculum developments present opportunities for established thinking and practice in physical education to be reaffirmed or challenged in government, professional and institutional arenas. The introduction of a new official text for the Victorian Certificate of Education Physical Education [VCEPE] in 2011 provided a prompt for renewed debate about the ways in which multiple ways of knowing' could prospectively find expression in senior secondary physical education. Previous analysis of the new VCEPE official text and associated assessment requirements led to a prediction that a theoretical-practical binary may well be reaffirmed amidst implementation of the new course in schools, such that senior secondary physical education (SSPE) in Victorian schools may remain an essentially propositional/theoretical subject.Purpose: This paper reports on research that has pursued this prediction and specifically explored the expression of Arnold's three dimensions of education in, through and about movement, in teachers' interpretation and enactment of the new VCEPE Study Design. The research sought to pursue the potential for originality and creativity in SSPE amidst the introduction of a new official curriculum text, examine factors facilitating or limiting this and document the pedagogic realities' of SSPE in Victorian schools.Methodology: The study used a case study approach, involving two government and two independent secondary schools in Victoria, Australia. Data gathered from teacher interviews, classroom observations and documentary sources in 2012-2013 are reported. Analysis pursued internal and external factors framing the curriculum and pedagogical practices prominent in enactment of the new course in the case study schools, and the individual and collective representation of Arnold's three dimensions of movement in the schools' curriculum and teachers' pedagogical practices.Findings: The findings reveal complexities and tensions associated with the representation of new curriculum policy in school curriculum and teachers' pedagogic practices. Attention is drawn to ways in which the interplay between official texts, accompanying assessment requirements, other professional texts and the wider educational context variously shape the pedagogic realities' of the VCEPE in practice. The discussion explains how this interplay influences (and limits) the expression of Arnold's dimensions in VCEPE.Implications: This paper reaffirms previous work in SSPE that has highlighted the need for conceptual coherence between curriculum texts and assessment frameworks. This research directs attention to opportunities for development of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment, through both official and professional channels, in ways that facilitate teachers' professional learning about the potential expression of Arnold's dimensions in VCEPE. It also calls for curriculum authorities, professional learning associations and teacher education institutions to work more coherently to be at the fore of thinking about pedagogic possibilities in senior secondary physical education.},

The experiment was conducted with undergraduate students, enrolled into four performing art courses (N = 77) at a research intensive university in Canada. The students used the video annotation software CLAS for course-based self-assessment on their performances. Although existing research offers insights into the factors predicting students' intentions of accepting a learning tool, much less is known about factors that affect actual adoption and sustained tool use. The study explored the use of CLAS amongst undergraduate students in four courses across two consecutive semesters. Trace data of students' tool use, graph-based measures of metacognitive monitoring, and text cohesion of video annotations were used to estimate the volume of tool use and the quality of the learning strategy and learning products created. The results confirmed that scaffolding (e.g., graded activity with instructional feedback) is required to guide students' initial tool use, although scaffolding did not have an independent significant effect on the quantity of tool use. The findings demonstrated that the use of the tool is strongly influenced by the experience an individual student gains from scaffolded conditions. That is, the students sustained their use of the learning tool in future courses even when the tool use was not graded nor was instructional feedback provided. An important implication is that students' tool use is not solely driven by motivation rather, it is shaped by instructional conditions and experience with the tool use. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION. As online learning increases, making text comprehensible to all learners presents challenges online course designers and teachers. The purpose of this study was to determine the cohesion properties of text from English language arts courses from three large online learning vendors. METHODS. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine congruence between the environments with respect to the five indices in the Coh Metrix 3.0 text measurement tool (Narrativity, Syntactic Simplicity, Word Concreteness, Referential Cohesion, and Deep Cohesion). RESULTS. Vendors may have calibrated their text using traditional tools like the Flesh-Kincaid scale. However, each of the courses had aspects of cohesion that needed improvement to provide an optimal advantage to students with disabilities or who have reading comprehension difficulties. Further, the two biggest factors that explained the variance in this study were Word Concreteness (the degree to which the words can be pictured) and Deep Cohesion (whether the connectives support inference). Importantly, these are also two aspects of texts that present the most challenges for students with disabilities. DISCUSSION. If all students are going to be successful with online courses, then vendors should move beyond simple reading level as a measure of text difficulty and plan course texts for students with more and different kinds of support for students who have reading difficulties that affect comprehension. Future research should perform similar analyses on content areas such as social studies and science. Additional studies should also look carefully and qualitatively at the complexity of the content itself and not just the text. Finally, additional research might look at how students with various reading challenges engage with online course texts using multiple data collection and analysis techniques.},

	abstract = {As readers move through a text, they engage in various types of processes that, if all goes well, result in a mental representation that captures their interpretation of the text. With each new text segment the reader engages in passive and, at times, reader-initiated processes. These processes are strongly influenced by the readers' representation of the preceding text and, in turn, update this very same representation. This updated representation forms the backdrop for the processing of the next text segment, and so on. Thus, passive and reader-initiated processes and the evolving representation engage in a continual, intricate interaction as the reader moves through the text. We provide a framework for conceptualizing the interplay between these three components of comprehension and propose that (1) passive and reader-initiated processes interact during reading; (2) a reader's standards of coherence moderate what kind and to what extent reader-initiated processes take place; (3) reader-initiated processes lie along a continuum from close-to-the-text, coherence-building processes to far-from-the-text, interpretive processes; and (4) the moment-to-moment processes and the evolving mental representation interact in a reciprocal fashion. We present results from recent experiments on key aspects of the framework, and identify questions the framework raises. We conclude with implications from this conceptualization for theoretical models of reading comprehension.},

The UK's National Student Survey (NSS) metrics are integrated into several 'Good University' calculations, whereas teaching teams most often use the survey's text comments to change practices, rather than the metrics directly. There is little information about how messages from the national survey's text comments relate to the accompanying numerical ratings, partly because text comments are confidential to the institution and unavailable for wide-scale research. We categorised institutional NSS text comments into themes that mirrored those of the original questionnaire. Comparisons were made between frequencies of thematic comments and the national ratings of satisfaction for several subject areas. For the first time, we demonstrate broad agreement between comments about measures of teaching staff and course organisation with the performance of the subject areas (compared to metrics of their national counterparts). These findings are consistent with previous quantitative models predicting the most important factors that most influence overall satisfaction ratings. We intend this study to be a catalyst for other institutions to explore their non-publicly available, textual returns in a similar way. The outcomes of this type of work are pertinent to all countries that use large-scale surveys. However, institutions will need to release findings to a public audience if we are to gain a national/international perspective on this key linkage between publicly available metrics and the associated text comments.},

The study validates TAACO by investigating how its indices related to local, global, and overall text cohesion can predict expert judgments of text coherence and essay quality. The findings of this study provide predictive validation of TAACO and support the notion that expert judgments of text coherence and quality are either negatively correlated or not predicted by local and overall text cohesion indices, but are positively predicted by global indices of cohesion. Combined, these findings provide supporting evidence that coherence for expert raters is a property of global cohesion and not of local cohesion, and that expert ratings of text quality are positively related to global cohesion.},

They were given conflicting science information about earthquake predictions to read while their eye movements during reading were recorded by the FaceLAB eye tracking system. After reading, the participants were interviewed to probe their reasoning performance. Our study showed that when university students were asked to read and reason about conflicting science information, those who paid more cognitive attention and efforts to the text areas related to backing theory, data, and warrants demonstrated better performances in coordinating theory and evidence, identifying evidence, and providing rebuttals, compared to students who paid less attention and made fewer cognitive efforts to these areas. The association between students' background knowledge and performance of scientific reasoning was weak. Compared to those with irrelevant backgrounds, students with relevant background knowledge tended to read more of the facts when the science information involved a simple experimental study, while their attention was directed more to data and claims when the experimental study was complicated or unfamiliar.

The didactic consequences of the interlanguage approach include, among other things, a different attitude towards errors, greater learners' autonomy and a focus on linguistic experimentation and hypotheses-testing. The article reports on a project that applied these principles in some Italian primary schools. Pupils worked in groups to produce long, complex and well-organized written texts retelling a silent movie. Data collected at the beginning and end of the school year reveal that these experimental classes outperformed control classes on a number of dimensions, including group cohesion and motivation, text quality assessed with rating scales, and objective measures like text length, number of idea units, use of punctuation and cohesive devices. It is argued that interlanguage analysis and the interlanguage approach should become an integral part of teacher training in all areas of language education.},

Results indicate that highlighting central information decreased the amount of rereading of peripheral information, whereas highlighting peripheral information increased the amount of rereading of peripheral information. Processing and recall of central information did not differ across highlighting conditions but were higher than the processing and recall of peripheral information (i.e., centrality effects). These findings suggest that highlighting influences processing of text but that this influence occurs after initial processing, interacts with centrality and is strongest for text information that is relatively peripheral to the overall coherence and meaning of the text. Proficient readers apparently selectively process and store central information regardless of what is highlighted in the text.},

A refutation text acknowledges the reader's alternative conceptions about a phenomenon, refutes them and presents the correct conceptions. We tested two hypotheses about its facilitation effect: the coherence hypothesis (refutation text is more coherent than standard text, thus facilitating comprehension) and the elaboration hypothesis (refutation text involves deeper processing, thus facilitating comprehension). Forty university students read one refutation text and one non-refutation text about two science topics. Offline data confirmed that refutation text readers recall more scientific facts than non-refutation text readers. Online eye-tracking measures revealed both an increase and a decrease in reading time in response to the refutation statements. Topic-medial text sentences with the correct science facts were fixated for a shorter time when first encountered in the refutation text. Refutation statements, however, increased integrative processing at the end of each text paragraph, as indexed by longer look-back fixation times on topic-final sentences with the science concepts, as well as longer look-back fixation times directed to the refutation statements. These findings support the elaboration hypothesis and are discussed in the light of current accounts of the refutation effect for theory development and educational practice.},

As a consequence, learners' main role is to respond to requests of the learning environment (e.g. by answering multiple-choice questions). This aspect of interactivity is, however, not sufficient to understand the complex benefits of interactivity for learners' knowledge acquisition. In order to create a higher level of interactivity, an instructional task that encourages learners to design learning materials for fellow learners is used in this paper. We will show that this instructional task can induce interactive elements because learners are encouraged to take not only their own perspective into account when designing. In addition, we investigated if the quality of source material affects knowledge acquisition in design tasks. In a two-by-two design, students (n = 108) had to design either a learning environment for others (i.e. to perform perspective-shifting), or a representation of acquired knowledge for themselves (no perspective-shifting) with less or more coherent information sources. Results indicate that performing perspective-shifting can be a powerful technique for eliciting interactive learning behavior and, thus, for learning. The quality of information sources does not influence knowledge acquisition to a great extent.},

The theory states that poor word representations and slow decoding processes consume resources in working memory that would otherwise be used to execute high-level comprehension processes, such as the generation of inferences. Previous research has yielded inconsistent findings about the importance of word decoding in adult readers, and the hypothesis has never been tested experimentally. Verbal efficiency theory was tested in this experiment by manipulating the difficulty of grapheme-phoneme conversion and assessing the extent to which readers made bridging inferences. Participants read two-sentence passages and then responded to lexical decision targets. Some of the passages required a bridging inference to integrate the first and second sentences. Decoding difficulty was manipulated such that the second sentence in some passages was written using pseudohomophones. Participants also received tasks to assess their working memory capacity and decoding ability. Inference priming was found in both the Standard American English and pseudohomophone contexts but was stronger in the former than in the latter. The advantage in priming for the Standard English relative to the pseudohomophone condition was predicted by an interaction between decoding skill and working memory capacity. Poor decoders who scored high on the span tests were less impaired by the pseudohomophone manipulation than were poor decoders who scored low on the tests. The results suggest that working memory capacity compensates for poor decoding skills even among proficient adult readers.},

The inclusion of chess terms also allows to recreate the atmosphere of the game, which is very important in the "game" text. In addition, the chess terms, entering into the syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations run through the fabric of the novel and form synonymous, antonymous and thematic repetitions which help to achieve the coherence of the text. It is noteworthy that Nabokov uses synonymous variants of the names of the figures, borrowed from different intermediary languages.

Self-explanation is a particularly effective strategy, but it is challenging to monitor how well a reader is applying self-explanation without requiring the reader to externalise the self-explanations being generated. Studies have shown that different reading strategies vary in the amount of cognitive control required as well as the engagement of brain regions involved in internally-directed attention. Pupil diameter is related to task engagement and cognitive control via the brain's locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. Therefore, pupil diameter could be a method to unobtrusively measure a reader's use of self-explanation. The current study assessed whether pupil diameter can be used to distinguish between the use of different reading strategies and whether it is linked to the quality and effectiveness of the strategy in terms of learning gains. Participants reread, paraphrased, and self-explained texts while pupil diameter was recorded, and completed comprehension tests. Average pupil diameter differed between all three reading strategies, and pupil diameter was related to learning gains and the quality of strategy use. The results suggest that pupil diameter could be used to track effective reading strategy utilisation.},

Coh-Metrix analyzes text on many constructs at different levels, including Word Concreteness (vs. abstractness), Narrativity (vs. informational), Deep Cohesion, Referential Cohesion, and Syntactic Simplicity. In previous research, texts in the natural sciences had lower Narrativity and Word Concreteness than texts in the language arts, but were higher in Syntactic Simplicity and Referential Cohesion. This pattern suggests a form of compensation in which difficulty on one dimension (e. g., Word Concreteness) is compensated for by increasing text ease on another dimension (e. g., Syntactic Simplicity). In the present study, we provide a further test of this compensation idea by analyzing oral language use across humanities and natural science lectures. We demonstrate that decreases in Word Concreteness across lectures are associated with increases in Narrativity, Deep Cohesion, and Syntactic Simplicity. In addition, within lectures, decreases in Word Concreteness are associated with increases in Syntactic Simplicity. Compensatory mechanisms are discussed in this article at different levels of language and discourse.},

Most traditional readability formulae are based on generalized linear models (GLMs; e.g., discriminant analysis and multiple regression), but these models have to comply with certain statistical assumptions about data properties and include all of the data in formulae construction without pruning the outliers in advance. The use of such readability formulae tends to produce a low text classification accuracy, while using a support vector machine (SVM) in machine learning can enhance the classification outcome. The present study constructed readability models by integrating multilevel linguistic features with SVM, which is more appropriate for text classification. Taking the Chinese language as an example, this study developed 31 linguistic features as the predicting variables at the word, semantic, syntax, and cohesion levels, with grade levels of texts as the criterion variable. The study compared four types of readability models by integrating unilevel and multilevel linguistic features with GLMs and an SVM. The results indicate that adopting a multilevel approach in readability analysis provides a better representation of the complexities of both texts and the reading comprehension process.},

In Study 2, we investigated novices' processing while learning with experts' and intermediates' explanations. We found that novices studying experts' explanations actively self-regulated their processing of the explanations, as they showed mainly deep-processing activities, whereas novices learning with intermediates' explanations were mainly engaged in shallow-processing activities by paraphrasing the explanations. Thus, we concluded that subject-matter expertise is a crucial prerequisite for instructors.

The essay had to be written in a very strict and unyielding format; it had to argue one of two viewpoints on offer prompted by an image which was already supplied and which introduced the task. Thus the essay was in a sequence of supplied introductory image, text to be written, concluding image to be found. The concluding image had to match the shape and size of the introductory image. It also had to match its colour, content and compositional register. Given the discipline of the students, many were surprisingly unsuccessful in this part of the task, and simply used images which matched the literal content of the introductory image and their essays. Even this literal matching was at times inaccurate and insensitive. The successful attempts used the text whose shortness meant that essay conventions were severely strained - as an eristic bridge between the two images. This meant that the successful essays exploited the rhetorical potential of format and tenets of iconology, Gombrich's 'invisible world of ideas'. In successful essays, the concluding image also acted as a check on the short text's coherence, because the importance of its content over exhibitionist techniques was always emphasized yet its shortness often made such techniques essential. This gave some essays an exquisite poise as readings oscillated between the three elements and meanings stayed nimble. The apparent grounding of the arguments in an image was in fact the signal for their flight.},

	abstract = {Information and communication technologies are heavily utilized in the lives of students: several studies have been conducted on effects of technology on learning and supporting writing instructions. Research indicates the positive effects of word processing (Goldberg, Russel \& Cook, 2003), spell check (MacArthur, Graham, Hayes, De la Paz, 1996) and speech synthesis (Kelly, Kratcoski, \& McLain, 2009). Despite the increasing attention, the effects of a multimodal approach on some phases of the writing process, such as organizing the ideas and constructing a text, have not been deeply investigated. When considering this topic, we need to consider the changes that have occurred in the concept of textuality: multiple forms can be texts, and texts can be multimodal (Thomas, 2010; Cope and Kalantzis 2009). Modes, such as words, audio, images, hyperlinks and video, are signs that carry meaning (Bezemer \& Kress, 2008). To examine this issue, we concentrated on the writing tasks based on a multiple and multimodal sourcing, that Italian students are asked to develop at the examination at the end of the Secondary School. The essays can concern different topics: in this study we focused on writing related to literature. Objectives: The study aimed to analyse the effects of a multimodal approach to literature and writing on the quality of writing expression and on motivation towards literature: we wondered if students' habits of multitasking and multimodal way of getting and linking information digitally could facilitate organizing strategies and the ability to structure a connected text and to articulate one's point of view, supporting arguments and embedding personal reworked references to texts. In order to investigate this issue, we used Glogster, a virtual poster web 2.0 tool, that enables writers to compose multimodal messages merging video, images, text, hyperlinks and audio. Method: Participants Forty students from two classes, attending 12th grade of Public Secondary School participated in the research. Method: Mix method research (quasi -experimental design) that comprised three phases: 1. Participants have been administered a pre -intervention test (adapted from Miall and Kuiken Response to Literature Questionnaire, 1994) to analyse the attitude towards literature and writing about literature and the quality of their writing performances. 2. The intervention has been structured in 4 workshops under the guide of an instructor: i. The comprehension of the sources. ii. Expressing your own ideas through Glogster tool. iii. Planning a traditional text. iv. Writing a traditional essay on the same topic as through Glogster. 3. All participants were administered a post -intervention test, that consisted of: - The pre -intervention questionnaire, to which three questions about the Glogster tool were added - Writing an essay based on multiple sourcing. Analysis: 1. The pre- and post-intervention essays will be assessed in terms of: a. Text organization (complex textual organization, coherence, cohesion) b. Intertextuality and intermodality c. Attention to the reader 2. The content of the poster will be analysed in terms of modes, semiotic resources and intersemiotic relationships (Jewitt, 2011). 3. The organization of the contents in the virtual posters will be compared to the organization of the ideas in the traditional essays.},

This article presents an experimental study aimed at analyzing the strategies used by students for integrating text and picture information. Four combinations of texts and pictures (text-picture units) were selected from textbooks on biology and geography, each combined with 3 comprehension test items of different complexity. Item difficulties were assessed in terms of item-response theory and through a cognitive task analysis. The texts, pictures, and items were presented to 40 students from Grades 5 and 8 from the higher tier and the lower tier of the German school system. Participants were asked to process the material and answer the items. Students' eye movements were recorded and analyzed in terms of number of fixations on different areas of interest as well as eye-movement transitions between these areas. Results suggest that text and pictures serve fundamentally different functions associated with different processing strategies in goal-directed knowledge acquisition. Texts are more likely to be used for coherence-oriented general processing. They guide the learner's conceptual analysis of the subject matter, which results in a coherent semantic network and initial mental model. Pictures are used as scaffolds for the initial mental model construction. Afterward, however, they are more likely to be used for task-driven selective processing serving as easily accessible visual representations on demand for item-specific mental model updates.},

For "example, low-knowledge students benefit from texts that explicitly state relationships between ideas, namely, those that possess high cohesion. Such texts limit the number of inferences a student must draw: a practice crucial for students lacking the requisite prior knowledge to fill in conceptual gaps. In this study, five best-selling general chemistry texts were analyzed using Coh-Metrix, a tool created to measure the linguistic characteristics of discourse and text. Our results constitute a survey of five measures of text difficulty: narrativity, syntactic simplicity, word concreteness, referential cohesion, and deep cohesion. Statistically significant differences were found when comparing the cohesion of the chemistry texts. Therefore, some texts may be more optimal for low-knowledge students than the others. In addition, four of the five texts had an optimal distribution of cohesion. This work also demonstrates the utility of Coh-Metrix as a tool that instructors can use to assess the appropriateness of learning materials for students based on their reading skill and prior chemistry knowledge.},

Seven patients with vmPFC lesions and seven demographically matched healthy comparison participants read short narratives. Using the consistency paradigm, narratives required participants to make either an emotional or visuo-spatial inference, in which a target sentence provided consistent or inconsistent information with a previous emotional state of a character or a visuo-spatial location of an object. Healthy comparison participants made the inferences both for spatial and emotional stories, as shown by longer reading times for inconsistent critical sentences. For patients with vmPFC lesions, inconsistent sentences were read slower in the spatial stories, but not in the emotional ones. This pattern of results is compatible with the hypothesis that vmPFC contributes to narrative comprehension by supporting inferences about socio-emotional aspects of verbally described situations.

The strategy originated from my desire to cater for my learners' need to become better writers in English within a constrained educational environment in Argentina. In this article I describe this strategy and show how it has worked in my setting. First, I offer the rationale on which it rests, based on a sociocultural conception of reading and writing. This involves brief considerations about the notions of collaborative writing groups, social responses to texts and coherence in L2 writing. Second, I describe and explain the strategy in detail, and include one handout with specific written instructions (as my learners received them) for the cooperative writing response groups with a focus on coherence, i.e. global aspects of the composing process. Finally, I exemplify the strategy using one learner's written text as a foundation (disclosed by permission).},

Results showed that text structure and reading goals affected cognitive conflict, coherence-building and elaborative processing while reading and promoted correct conceptual knowledge included in essays but failed to affect the inclusion of misconceptions. Further, participants with evaluativist epistemic beliefs engaged in fewer comprehension monitoring processes and were more likely to adapt their coherence-building processes according to reading goals than their non-evaluativist counterparts, but epistemic belief groups did not differ in the content of the posttest essay.

To facilitate these comprehension processes, a variety of multimedia design principles have been proposed.

Ninety high school students learned about cohesion via animated lesson videos from the Writing Pal intelligent tutoring system. Videos were crafted such that narrated and onscreen written content overlapped by 10\%, 26\%, or 50\%. Across conditions, students gained significantly in their knowledge of cohesion-building strategies and the effects of cohesion on writing quality. However, degree of redundancy did not influence learning gains. Additionally, although more-skilled readers outperformed less-skilled readers, reading skill did not interact with the degree of redundancy. These results provide evidence that a broad range of partially redundant multimedia materials may be viable instructional tools that benefit diverse learners.

In Experiment 2, text coherence was disrupted by scrambling the order of the sentences from the text. The material was subsequently presented as a list of facts as opposed to connected discourse. For the incoherent version of the text, testing slowed down the rate of forgetting compared to a restudy (control) condition. The results suggest that the connectedness of materials can play an important role in determining the magnitude of testing benefits for long-term retention.

Connectives also trigger readers to make regressions to preceding information. These findings indicate that connectives function as immediate "processing instructions."

The notion of text has been specified within the structural-and-grammatical, semantic, communicative and semiotic approaches. The main standards of textuality have been discussed. The integrity as one of the crucial criteria pertaining to the text is associated with the standards of cohesion and coherence. The main divergences between the cohesion and coherence have been established. Cohesion is determined as a formal aspect of the textual integrity which is concerned with the lexicogrammatic relations within the text. The coherence as a content integrity is predetermined by the text theme. It has been stipulated that the communicative unity of the text is achieved through the information flow, establishing anaphoric or cataphoric relations throughout the informative structure of the text. The research has been aimed at the organization and characterizing of the principal linguistic devices used to provide the formal integrity. The cohesion is based on the formal iteration, which involves various types of recurrence, reference, ellipsis and substitution, and formal relation that is achieved by means of conjunction and word order.},

The results shed light on the cognitive reading processes of students in secondary education, which allows us to explain effects of text features on off-line comprehension measures. Our eye-tracking data emphasize the importance of connectives: Connectives speed up students' processing, especially when texts have a continuous layout. In contrast, students' processing slows when they read texts with a discontinuous layout. Our data also show a correlation between reading times and scores on bridging inference tasks: Students who read faster have higher comprehension scores.

We seek to heal the fractures and smooth over the lapses of meaning in the student texts we work with. In fact, our aim is to usher students into the very discourses Irigaray argues oppress and suppress the feminine in Western culture. This paper reflects on this seeming contradiction and the ethical and philosophical questions it raises. In particular, it draws on Irigaray's recent work on language and teaching to suggest that through a "horizontal" relationship between the learning adviser and the student, it may be possible to create the conditions in which the feminine can take place.},

Expertise was induced by adding expository examples and illustrations to the introductory text to enhance text coherence and facilitate text comprehension. The expertise reversal effect was replicated for the dependent measure transfer, but not for retention. Results and implications for adaptive learning environments are discussed.},

One type of vocabulary that has yet to be properly investigated has been linking adverbials. Linking adverbials serve to assist writers in giving cohesion to their texts. They are also difficult for second language writers to acquire, with many language learners misusing them semantically and stylistically. This study attempts to determine if DDL can assist students with this task. It investigates the correct semantic usage and proportion of academic linking adverbials in student writing both before and following treatment. Results indicate that DDL techniques do in fact help students acquire and better employ linking adverbials in their writing. Students receiving DDL instruction made greater improvements in their use of linking adverbials, both semantically and stylistically, compared to a group that received traditional linking adverbial instruction.},

Sixty test-takers' speaking samples from the listen/speak section of the TOEFL-iBT were analyzed in terms of textual integration at the lexical and cohesion level and how this integration predicted human scores of speaking proficiency. The results indicate that the properties of the source text are strongly predicative of which words test takers will integrate into their response.

This logical and semantic consistency relating to the construction and configuration of sense in a text is called coherence by text linguists. Coherence is vital for a complete meaning and understanding of a text. As a cohesive device, reference, especially anaphoric reference, has been examined in many studies in recent years. This study aims to investigate anaphoric expressions by Turkish speakers of French in their spontaneous speech. 29 undergraduate students (23 females and 6 males) with 22-25 age range studying at a French language department in Turkey as well as five native speakers of French (three females and two males) with 35-55 age range participated in the study. French dubbed version of an animated cartoon, A Christmas Carol (Mickey et la Magie de Noel), was used as material in this study. The participants were asked to watch and then comment on various themes in the cartoon. Results revealed an overuse of third person pronouns, almost cumulative, in students. Possible reasons of this aggregate usage were then discussed in light of other studies in literature. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The results of this study show that linguistic features can be used to significantly predict essay scores in the integrated as well as the independent writing. When comparing across the two writing tasks, there are both similarities and differences in the two sets of predictive features. For instance, lexical sophistication was found to be a significant predictor for both tasks while features such as verbs in 3rd person singular form and semantic similarity were only significant predictors for the integrated task. These findings demonstrate that evaluation of the two writing tasks rely on similar and distinct features, and are at least partially assessed using different linguistic criteria.

	abstract = {The effects of four hypertext learning environments with a hierarchical graphical overview were studied on the coherence of the node sequence, extraneous load and comprehension. Navigation patterns were influenced by the type of overview provided (i.e., dynamic, static) and whether navigation was restricted (i.e., restricted, non-restricted). It was hypothesised that redundant use of the overview for inducing a high-coherence reading sequence would result in high extraneous load and low comprehension. Coherence was higher in the dynamic than in the static conditions. Coherence was also higher in the restricted than in the non-restricted conditions. Mental effort as a measure of extraneous load was higher at the end than at the beginning of the learning phase, especially in the dynamic restricted and the static nonrestricted conditions, although there was no significant interaction. Comprehension was lowest in the dynamic restricted condition and highest in the dynamic non-restricted and static restricted conditions. Low comprehension in the dynamic restricted condition indicates that overviews can become redundant for reading sequence coherence, negatively impacting comprehension. The evidence suggests that severe restriction of navigation paths should be avoided and that continuous use of overviews such as in dynamic overviews may be detrimental to learning.

These theoretical approaches encouraged the teachers to situate the texts in relation to other related texts that supported students in making inferential links. Moreover, teacher pedagogic discourse became newly focused on text structure and coherence as the whole class read the text together and rapidly to the end with pleasure and understanding. The long-term impact of the action research suggests that such a theorised approach can influence teachers' practice at a deep and sustainable level and in one school led to the introduction of a daily reading lesson where students read whole narratives they selected themselves, raising their reading ages and creating a reading culture.},

We compared scripted (script+) with unscripted (script-) collaboration in a wild-based writing setting that was adapted for educational purposes. Students from two university courses participated in a one-week collaborative writing activity. Results showed that students in the scripted condition outperformed students in the unscripted condition with respect to revision behavior and text coherence. Furthermore, we found that students' revision behavior correlated positively with text coherence. Results from analyzing students' discussions during the writing activity revealed more frequent coordination with respect to task division and increased communication frequency for students in the scripted condition. Results also indicate that collaboration scripts can foster coordination. Our findings suggest that collaboration scripts are promising means of structuring collaboration during wiki-based writing.

	abstract = {What patterns of multimodal rhetoric characterizes the most successful texts meant for learning - inside or outside school? This article argues that the balance between cohesion and tension in the interplay between modes is an issue at the core of this challenging question. Texts meant for learning need both cohesion and tension in order to be both understandable and engaging. While cohesion has long been a central issue of interest among researchers of multimodal texts, the same can hardly be said about multimodal tension. The article offers a discussion of the concepts of multimodal cohesion and tension, relating them to three dimensions of user-text interaction: the dimensions of perception, interpretation and performativity. This elaboration concludes with the outline of a framework model for analytical purposes. The model is, thereafter, used in an illustrative analysis of an award-winning multimodal feature story collected from the online site of the New York Times.},

The technologies developed from this interdisciplinary fusion are helping students learn and think in ways that are sensitive to their cognitive and emotional states. Recent projects have developed computer technologies that help us understand the nature of conversational discourse and text comprehension in addition to improving learning. AutoTutor and other systems with conversational agents (i.e., talking heads) help students learn by holding conversations in natural language. One version of AutoTutor is sensitive to the emotions of students in addition to their cognitive states. Coh-Metrix analyzes texts on multiple levels of language and discourse, such as text genre, cohesion, syntax, and word characteristics. Coh-Metrix can assist students, teachers, principals, and policymakers when they make decisions on the right text to assign to the right student at the right time. Computers are not perfect conversation partners and comprehenders of text, but the current systems are undeniably useful.},

This study aims to develop a computer-aided text construction system which supports 83 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) university students in inserting sentences to construct texts with the scaffoldings of lexical cohesion and sentence relations. The students' actions in text construction were recorded in a recording module which showed their metacognitive process during the task. Results of this study revealed that the engagement in metacognitive process was rarely found in the students who made little progress through three online texts. The students who demonstrated the developmental progress in three texts were actively engaged in the metacognitive process to monitor and evaluate their text constructive problems. They then frequently revised the text by reselecting the sentences with the assistance of lexical cohesion and sentence relations. It was further found that students' metacognition could be strengthened by the text construction task. The increased engagement in metacognition, especially reselecting the sentences (revising), led to higher scores being obtained in text construction.},

	abstract = {Objectives This article discusses the need for, and value of, providing students with instruction in how to use comprehension strategies as well as the effectiveness of inducing strategy use through cognitive disequilibrium. The leading assumption that guides this article is that learning facts and figures is not enough. Students need to build deep knowledge that is interconnected, coherent and includes understanding of potential causal mechanisms. Doing so requires going beyond the printed page by generating inferences and developing coherent explanations. Inferences and explanations allow the student to make links between concepts in the material and, importantly, to make connections to prior knowledge. These connections render students' understanding of new material more coherent and, in consequence, deeper and more stable. Discussion This article describes two means of inducing students to construct a deeper understanding of new material. One means of challenging students is through cohesion gaps in a text (or a lecture) that require the student to generate inferences to understand the relationships between concepts. Although low-knowledge readers are not able to generate these inferences, relatively high-knowledge readers (e.g. medical students) are more likely to successfully generate inferences to bridge conceptual gaps, and doing so results in a deeper understanding of the material. A second means of inducing active processing is to provide students with instruction and practice in how to use comprehension strategies. This article describes methods of providing such instruction, including the intelligent tutoring system, iSTART. Conclusions The overarching goal of the research described in this article is to scaffold students towards ideal learning strategies. This cannot happen simply by telling students about good strategies. It is ineffective to inform a student that the content will be better understood if it is explained or evaluated. Such an approach is a victim of learning by consumption attitudes towards education.},

The JOC task required the participants to decide whether sentence pairs were coherent. The results indicated that both variables influenced JOC for both types of readers, but that semantic relatedness had a greater impact on less-skilled readers, whereas causal relatedness had a greater influence on the skilled readers.

Participants in the study were 24 adults. Overall subjective ratings of disorientation and cognitive load, as well as detailed analysis of eye movement and navigation data were used. The results showed that LPK learners gained equal factual knowledge from the HS and NS concept maps, gained more conceptual knowledge from the HS concept map, and had to invest less mental effort in the posttest after learning with the HS concept map. On the other hand, HPK learners gained more factual knowledge from the HS concept map than from the NS concept map, and gained equal conceptual knowledge from both concept-map structures. Also, LPK learners experienced higher disorientation during learning with the NS concept map than the HS map, whereas no differential effect of concept-map structure was found for HPK learners. Both LPK and HPK learners invested less mental effort in processing the HS concept map. The eye tracking and navigation data provided more detailed insight into these findings. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Reading times and humor ratings were gathered from 76 participants using behavioral response data. Results demonstrate that a higher age results in significantly higher reading times for satirical compared with nonsatirical headlines. In addition, levels of prior knowledge significantly interacted with different satirical strategies, influencing both reading times and perceptions of humor. Measures of headline familiarity and sincerity also interacted with perceptions of humor and satirical strategy. These results provide additional evidence for the importance that age, prior knowledge, and satirical strategies have on satire comprehension.},

Furthermore, research is lacking concerning the role of individual differences in learning from retrieval.

Students completed in-class exercises that required them to retrieve course information (e.g., recalling definitions for terms and labeling diagrams) followed by feedback or to simply copy the information without retrieving it. A later quiz over the information showed that high-performing students benefited more from retrieving than copying, whereas middle- and low-performing students benefited more from copying than retrieving. When asked to predict their quiz scores following the in-class exercises, high-performers demonstrated better overall metacognitive calibration compared to middle- or low-performers.
