## Participants and design

Undergraduate and graduate phontecis and psychology students (80.8% female,
median age = 21, IQR = 3, range = [18, 31]) from the University of Zagreb
participated in the study in exchange for course credit. Participants were
randomly assigned to one of five groups which differed in type of activity
between parts of the text and in whether they are to receive feedback on their
intermittent test achievement or not
(\(n_{reread}\) = `r datHard %>% count(condition) -> .; (.) %>% filter(condition == 'rereading') %>% pull(n)`,
\(n_{content, feed}\) = `r (.) %>% filter(condition == 'content_feedback') %>% pull(n)`,
\(n_{content, nofeed}\) = `r (.) %>% filter(condition == 'content_noFeedback') %>% pull(n)`,
\(n_{general, feed}\) = `r (.) %>% filter(condition == 'general_feedback') %>% pull(n)`,
\(n_{general, nofeed}\) = `r (.) %>% filter(condition == 'general_noFeedback') %>% pull(n)`).

## Materials and procedure

Participants read a text on the evolution, ecological and biological characteristics
of weeds. The text was taken from a chapter in a Croatian university-level textbook.
Some sentences and passages were slightly modified, so as to avoid odd language
constructions; Latin plant names were translated to Croatian, and some plants
were removed from the text to make it less difficult for the target participant
population. The text was divided into three parts of 874, 754, and 835 words,
respectively. Additionaly, there was a practice text taken from the same chapter,
but unrelated to any of the other three parts of the text (768 words).

Forty-four content related questions, with four response options, were generated
from the presented texts. Four questions were presented after the practice text,
ten after each of the first two parts, and twenty after the third part of the text.
Starting from the second ten question set, the distractor options were chosen so that
\begin{enumerate*}[label = (\roman*)]
\item aaa
\item bbb
\end{enumerate*}
