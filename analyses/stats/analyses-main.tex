Prior to analysing the data, we have excluded participants based on a
priori set criteria. Participants who have spent less than or equal to
90 seconds on the practice text were excluded (1 exclusion). Further, we
wanted to exclude participants who have had no correct answers on the
final test (0 exclusions). Finally, we have excluded participants who
have stated that they have reading deficits (3 exclusions). This left us
with a total sample of 203 participants. The descriptives for the sample
are shown in Table \ref{descTable}. There is another set of exclusion
criteria based on the number of times the participants have read each of
the three texts. These are used in robustness check analyses (see
suplementary materials).

\hypertarget{interpolated-activity-effect}{%
\subsubsection{Interpolated activity
effect}\label{interpolated-activity-effect}}

Our first two hypotheses are concerned with the effects of different
interpolated activities on the total number of correct answers and total
number of intrusive distractors chosen. To test these hypotheses, we
have focused only on the groups which have not received feedback, since
there was no feedback option for the rereading group (\(n\) = 122). We
conducted a one-way MANOVA with interpolated activity as the independent
variable and the total number of correct and intrusive options chosen as
dependent variables. The correlation between our DVs calculated on the
whole sample is -0.71 (95\% CI: {[}-0.77, -0.63{]}, \(p\) =
\(4.793\times 10^{-32}\)). Boxplots for the groups in this analysis are
shown in Figure \ref{box1}.

\begin{figure*}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{analyses-main_files/figure-latex/boxPlot-1} 

}

\caption{\label{box1} Boxplots broken down by experimental conditions included in the first MANOVA, and dependent variable, with overlayed raw scores.}\label{fig:boxPlot}
\end{figure*}

Pillai's V for the analysis is 0.126, \(p = 0.004\) (Wilks' \(\Lambda\)
= 0.875, \(p = 0.003\); Hotelling-Lawley's trace = 0.142, \(p = 0.003\);
Roy's largest root = 0.137, \(p = 4.912\times 10^{-4}\). The effect
size, calculated as \(\omega^2_{mult} = 0.109\)
(bootstrap\textsubscript{R = 10000} median = 0.132, \(BC_\alpha\) 95\%
CI = {[}0.012, 0.201{]}). To further inspect the relationship of the
interpolated activities with our dependent variables, we have conducted
a Roy-Bargmann stepdown analysis, as suggested by
\citeauthor{tabachnick_using_2012} (\citeyear{tabachnick_using_2012}; a
linear discriminant analysis with the same aim is available in the
supplementary materials). The total number of correct answers was a
priori chosen to be the higher priority variable. Therefore, we first
conducted an ANOVA with interpolated activity type as the indepedent
variable and the total number of correct answers as the dependent
variable.

As could be expected, the ANOVA points to an interpolated activity
effect, with \(F(2, 119)\) = 7.541, \(p = 8.254\times 10^{-4}\).
Following the ANOVA, we conducted an ANCOVA, with the total number of
correct answers as the covariate, and the total number of intrusors as
the dependent variable. As could be expected, the results imply a main
effect of the total number of correct answers (\(F(1, 118)\) = 79.674,
\(p = 6.873\times 10^{-15}\)). After correcting for the number of
correct answers, there is no evidence for an effect of interpolated
activity on the total number of chosen intrusors (\(F (2, 118)\) =
0.844, \(p = 0.433\). For now, we may claim that we do not have any
evidence to support our second hypothesis that the type of interpolated
activity will have an effect on the number of intrusors.

In order to test our first hypothesis, we have contrasted (i) the
rereading group with the two test groups, and (ii) the two test groups
with each other, taking only the total number of correct answers as the
DV. The first contrast finds no evidence of a difference between the
rereading group and the two test groups (\(t\) = 1.355, \(p = 0.178\),
\(g_s\) = 0.19, 95\% CI = {[}-0.19, 0.57{]}, Cohens's \(U_{3, g_s}\) =
57.6\%, probability of superiority = 55.39\%). However, there is a
difference between the two test groups (\(t\) = 3.62,
\(p = 4.34\times 10^{-4}\), \(g_s\) = 0.66, 95\% CI = {[}0.21, 1.1{]},
Cohens's \(U_{3, g_s}\) = 74.43\%, probability of superiority =
67.88\%). These two findings are not in line with our predictions.

\hypertarget{the-interaction-between-feedback-and-interpolated-activity-type}{%
\subsubsection{The interaction between feedback and interpolated
activity
type}\label{the-interaction-between-feedback-and-interpolated-activity-type}}

The remaining hypotheses deal with the effect of feedback on the total
number of correct answers and the total number of intrusors. Therefore,
these analyses are carried out only on the data from participants in the
general and content related test conditions (\(n\) = 163). Boxplots for
these groups are shown in Figure \ref{box2}. To test these hypotheses,
we first conducted a two-way MANOVA with interpolated activity and
feedback as independent variables, and total number of correct answers
and total number of intrusors as the dependent variables.

\begin{figure*}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{analyses-main_files/figure-latex/boxPlot2-1} 

}

\caption{\label{box2} Boxplots broken down by experimental conditions included in the second MANOVA, and dependent variable, with overlayed raw scores.}\label{fig:boxPlot2}
\end{figure*}

Pillai's V for the interpolated activity effect (calculated with type
III sums of squares) is 0.071, \(p = 0.003\) (Wilks' \(\Lambda\) =
0.929, \(p = 0.003\); Hotelling-Lawley's trace = 0.08, \(p = 0.003\);
Roy's largest root = 0.08, \(p = 0.003\)) confirming the main effect of
interpolated activity type. The effect size \(\omega^2_{mult}\) = 0.065
(bootstrap\textsubscript{R = 10000} median = 0.072, \(BC_\alpha\) 95\%
CI = {[}0.007, 0.139{]}).

On the other hand, we find no evidence for an effect of giving feedback
on the linear combination of our two dependent variables --- Pillai's V
= 0.003, \(p = 0.8\) (Wilks' \(\Lambda\) = 0.997, \(p = 0.8\);
Hotelling-Lawley's trace = 0, \(p = 0.8\); Roy's largest root = 0,
\(p = 0.8\)). The effect size is \(\omega^2_{mult}\) = -0.003
(bootstrap\textsubscript{R = 10000} median = 0.003\footnote{
The \(BC_\alpha\) 95\% CI for this estimate is \([-0.006, 0.004]\).
Our guess is that this odd result is due to the fact that most of the density is concentrated
around 0, causing an unreliable estimate.\label{bca-ref}}).

Furthermore, we find no evidence for an interaction effect between
activity type and feedback --- Pillai's V = 0.001, \(p = 0.941\) (Wilks'
\(\Lambda\) = 0.999, \(p = 0.941\); Hotelling-Lawley's trace = 0,
\(p = 0.941\); Roy's largest root = 0, \(p = 0.941\)). The effect size
\(\omega^2_{mult}\) = -0.005 (bootstrap\textsubscript{R = 10000} median
= 0.003\footnote{
Same as footnote \ref{bca-ref}. \(BC_\alpha\) 95\% CI = \([-0.006, -0.005]\).}).
Both the feedback and the interaction estimates of \(\omega^2_{mult}\)
are to be considered to be zero, given their negative values.

Again, we have conducted a follow-up Roy-Bargmann stepdown analysis. In
the ANOVA model with the total number of correct answers as the
dependent variable and the type of interpolated activity, feedback and
their interaction as predictors, only the type of activity seems to be
relevant (\(F(1, 159) = 11.2, p = 0.001\)). In the second step, we fit
an ANCOVA model with the total number of correct answers as the
covariate. In this model, the type of interpolated activity ceases to be
a relevant predictor (\(F(1, 155) = 0.175, p = 0.676\)).
