# Tests

## H1 + H2

We plan to conduct a MANOVA with interpolated activity as a dependent variable, and the number of
correct answers on the final test and the proportion of chosen intrusive distractors among
incorrect answers. We will perform this analysis only on the subset of participants not receiving feedback.

In case of a statistically significant Wilks' lambda, we will proceed with assessing planned contrasts analysis.
We aim to compare the two test groups with the rereading group.

We plotted the power obtained with our sample size (N = 125) and the sample size we expect to work with after 
our exclusion criteria have been applied (N = 110) as a function of a range of effect sizes, depicted in
the images below.

As can be seen from the images, with our effective sample size we expect to have .8 power to detect an effect
size in the medium range. 

Furthermore, in order to investigate whether there is no difference between the two test groups, we will
conduct a two-one-sided t-tests (TOST) procedure, as well as a Bayesian t-test.

### TOST

The smallest effect size of interest (SEOSI) we would like to detect is Cohen's d = 0.25. This SESOI
was chosen because:
a) it falls within Cohen's proposed "small" effect size range
b) according to the Chan et al. meta-analysis, if the effect exists, it should probably be larger
c) it represents a 57% probability of superiority of one group over the other (calculated through
`https://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/`). Fifty seven per cent was practically chosen aribtrarily,
but it represent a just-above-chance probability.

Still, we think this SESOI is quite conservative.

### Bayesian t-test

## H3 to H6

To test these hypotheses, we also plan to conduct a MANOVA with feedback and interpolated activity
as the independent variables and the number of correct answers on the final test and the proportion 
of chosen intrusive distractors among incorrect answers. In line with the hypotheses, we will be 
looking at the main effect of feedback on 


We plotted the power obtained with our sample size (N = 166) and the sample size we expect to work with after 
our exclusion criteria have been applied (N = 145) as a function of a range of effect sizes, depicted in

As can be seen from the images, with our effective sample size we expect to have .8 power to detect an effect
size in the lower medium range.
