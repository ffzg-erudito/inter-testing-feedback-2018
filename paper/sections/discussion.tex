The aim of this study was to explore the effects of different interpolated 
activities and feedback reception on learning complex materials. We found 
evidence for an effect of interpolated activity type on TPNL — treating the 
two dependent variables as manifestations of TPNL, we conducted a MANOVA, 
revealing that participants engaging in episodic retrieval exhibited greater 
TPNL than both participants who engaged in semantic retrieval and those in 
the control condition. Moreover, a Roy-Bargmann stepdown analysis showed 
that observed differences were driven primarily by the number of correct 
responses, while finding no evidence for the contribution of PI.

The fact that we observed the effect of interest while employing a testing 
format which is known to produce the smallest effects is interesting in and 
of itself, and suggests that the effect should hold in conditions that are 
arguably the most prevalent in the western educational system. Nevertheless, 
our results are not entirely in line with extant research. For example, 
\cite{pastotterRetrievalLearningFacilitates2011} suggest that both types of 
retrieval can generate TPNL, while our results point to an exclusive role of 
episodic retrieval. Notably, the effects observed by these authors were 
obtained by using simpler learning materials and free recall — both learning 
material complexity and testing format figure prominently as moderators of 
TPNL \citep{chanRetrievalPotentiatesNew2018}. However, the few studies that 
examined the effects of nonepisodic recall on TPNL have produced equivocal 
results. While two studies suggested that nonepisodic and episodic recall 
have comparable effects \citep{divisRetrievalSpeedsContext2014, 
pastotterRetrievalLearningFacilitates2011}, 
\cite{weinsteinNotAllRetrieval2015} failed to show this. Among a number of 
methodological differences between these studies, the specific type of 
nonepisodic recall stands out as a possible reason behind the diverging 
results. While \cite{pastotterRetrievalLearningFacilitates2011} and 
\cite{divisRetrievalSpeedsContext2014} both used semantic generation, 
\cite{weinsteinNotAllRetrieval2015} used recall from autobiographical 
memory. Delineating the potential distinctive effects various forms of 
non-episodic recall could have in the TPNL paradigm is a goal future studies 
may pursue.

Studies that have suggested that nonepisodic recall may serve as an effective
method of learning potentiation have drawn on context and resource theories 
to explain their results \citep{divisRetrievalSpeedsContext2014, 
pastotterRetrievalLearningFacilitates2011}. 
\cite{divisRetrievalSpeedsContext2014} proposed that retrieval processes 
enhance context fluctuation, thereby increasing the contextual disparity 
between information acquired across study sessions. This, in turn, reduces 
the memory search set and PI. The absence of an effect of semantic retrieval 
on learning in our study may be taken as evidence against this context 
change account of TPNL because, presumably, semantic retrieval should have 
produced the internal context change required for resetting the encoding 
process \citep{pastotterRetrievalLearningFacilitates2011}.A Bayesian 
estimate of the effect of nonepisodic recall also lends support for the 
claim that it does not enhance learning (see supplementary materials). 
Still, a basic assumption we have made is that the interpolated activity 
that served the function of activating retrieval from semantic memory in our 
study was effective. 

While we found no evidence for an effect of feedback on TPNL, exploratory 
Bayesian analyses do not exclude the possibility of a feedback effect, but 
the obtained estimates point to an effect which could be practically 
equivalent to zero. From this we gather that the collected data provide no 
evidence that a PI reduction mechanism underpins TPNL. Interpreting these 
results warrants caution, though, since a more precise estimate of the 
effect is desirable.

Importantly, our choice of learning materials could have prevented us from 
finding evidence in favour of context theories and an account based on the 
reduction of PI. However, previous work has shown that release from PI may 
play basically no role when it comes to learning complex materials 
\cite{wissmanInterimTestEffect2011}. The recognition-level method which we 
employed showed no signs of PI beyond those expected to occur by chance 
alone. Admittedly, limiting the number of choices by displaying possible 
answers may have diluted the interference effect other unwritten pieces of 
information might have had, if we had used free recall instead.

To account for TPNL, \cite{wissmanInterimTestEffect2011} proposed that 
interpolated testing induces a stronger activation and retention of learned 
information, whose accessibility further facilitates comprehension and 
encoding of new related materials, which is in line with the ideas behind 
integration theories. More recent studies provided supportive evidence for 
explanations relying on changes in patterns of mind-wandering 
\citep{szpunarInterpolatedMemoryTests2013}, whereby testing increases 
mind-wandering related to the acquired information
\citep{jingInterpolatedTestingInfluences2016}. 
\cite{wissmanInterimTestEffect2011} suggested an additional nonconflicting 
metacognitive explanation based on encoding strategy changes, mediated by 
possible failures of retrieval 
\citep{bahrickImportanceRetrievalFailures2005}. In line with these 
proposals, recent studies have shown that retrieval modifies the learner's 
approach to new information \citep{choTestingEnhancesBoth2017, 
soderstromTestingFacilitatesRegulation2014}, which may lead to superior 
semantic organisation of acquired knowledge 
\citep{chanTestingPotentiatesNew2018, jingInterpolatedTestingInfluences2016}.

Finally, we have to address certain methodological concerns.  In our study, 
participants were thoroughly informed regarding the activities they would 
encounter during the procedure, including the final test following the last 
reading episode. The typical instruction given to participants in the TPNL 
paradigm is that interpolated activities will be determined randomly
\cite{yangEnhancingLearningRetrieval2018}. Thus, an attempt is made to 
equalise expectations of a final test across conditions, and to ensure 
continued processing of materials across the study sequences. Nevertheless, 
learners dynamically adjust their expectations based on their experiences of 
the procedure, regardless of the instructions they are given 
\citep{weinsteinRoleTestExpectancy2014}.  If they take a test, they will 
more likely expect another one, and such expectations are known to influence 
encoding (e.g. \citealp{szpunarExpectationFinalCumulative2007}). 


Further, we cannot exclude the possibility that our interpolated activities 
had differential effects on our participants’ motivation. Several 
participants remarked that the text was tedious, and it is possible that the 
motivation of participants in the episodic retrieval condition persisted 
throughout the procedure, while that of the other participants waned as the 
procedure progressed. However, if this were true, we should have observed 
the lowest scores in the rereading group. Yet, this is not the case. 
Furthermore, we find no reason to believe that answering general knowledge 
questions is less interesting than answering questions about weeds, and 
presume that the former would, therefore, help sustain motivation. On the 
other hand, differences in engagement could have been caused by unequal task 
difficulties — the mean proportions of correctly answered questions are 
larger in the content-related than in the general-knowledge testing 
conditions. Importantly, the mean proportion of correct answers on the first 
interpolated content-related test is higher than on the second. If the tests 
were equally difficult, and if there had been a TPNL effect, we would expect 
higher scores on the second test. This points to the tentative conclusion 
that the interpolated tests themselves differed in difficulty. Thus, we 
cannot reject the possibility that differing difficulties affected our 
participants’ achievement. However, \citet{divisRetrievalSpeedsContext2014} 
argue that the difficulty of the interpolated tasks is irrelevant. Still, 
such claims are yet to be corroborated by experimental data.

To conclude, our findings confirm the effect of episodic recall on TPNL, but 
we fail to find evidence for an effect of semantic recall. Further, evidence 
for an effect of feedback is also lacking. Our data are generally aligned 
with predictions stemming from metacognitive and integration theories of 
TPNL, and speak against PI reduction accounts within the wider framework of 
resource theories.
