\section{Abstract}

This study explored the effects of retrieval and feedback on 
test-potentiated new learning. Participants read a text divided into three 
parts, between which they engaged in either episodic retrieval, semantic 
retrieval, or rereading. Participants in the retrieval conditions were 
randomly assigned to either receive or not to receive feedback on their 
achievement. We administered multiple choice questions whose distractors 
were designed specifically to facilitate proactive interference. Planned 
analyses showed that participants in the episodic retrieval condition scored 
higher on the final test than participants in the other two groups. Feedback 
was found to have no bearing on new learning --- neither on its own, nor via 
interaction with the interpolated activity type. No effect regarding the 
number of proactive intrusions was found, although exploratory Bayesian 
analyses preclude rejecting an effect. Results are interpreted in terms of 
metacognitive theories that have previously been suggested as an explanation 
of the effect.

\section{General Audience Summary}

Contemporary cognitive science has shown that activities people engage in 
after a study session have a significant effect on the learning outcome. The 
choice of whether to simply reread, or to rather attempt to recall the 
studied information from memory, has a non-negligible impact on long-term 
retention, with studies overwhelmingly supporting the latter option. 
Furthermore, trying but failing to retrieve a piece of information may have 
a silver lining in that it can actually make it more susceptible to 
successful memory processing in the future. It is assumed that active 
retrieval engages and refines generic mental processes that are also called 
upon at a more critical hour --- during some final examination. 

A closely related line of research seems to suggest that a memory test can 
even boost future learning of unrelated information. This somewhat puzzling 
effect is called test-potentiated \textit{new} learning. Moreover, a number 
of studies examined a possibility that the key ingredient is not necessarily 
a test pertaining to the studied information. It was suggested that 
retrieval in general, be it from short-term or long-term memory, could be 
the cause of improvement in future learning. In short, retrieval itself 
seems to enhance memory for events that follow. 

However, these studies mostly used fairly simple learning materials such as 
word lists. Our study, therefore, examined whether this effect generalises 
to everyday circumstances. Three groups of participants studied three 
paragraphs of text in sequence, and engaged in different activities between 
studying. One group reread the texts, another was given general knowledge 
questions, and the last group was given questions concerning the paragraphs. 
Our results show that when it comes to learning information that is 
typically found in an educational context, the safest bet would be to insert 
memory tests related to the studied material in between your study sessions.

\section{Notes}

Analyses conducted using the \textit{R} language
\citep{rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2019}.
Bootstrap conducted using the \textit{boot} package
\citep{cantyBootBootstrapSPlus2017}. Methods and analyses written using
\textit{rmarkdown} \citep{allaireRmarkdownDynamicDocuments2019} and
\textit{knitr} \citep{xieKnitrGeneralPurposePackage2019}. The package
\textit{car} \citep{foxCompanionAppliedRegression2011} was used to
obtain type III sums of squares. \textit{compute.es}
\citep{reComputeEsCompute2013} was used to obtain effect sizes for
contrasts. \textit{kableExtra} was used to help generate tables
\citep{zhuKableExtraConstructComplex2019}. Other utilities used are
