\section{Abstract}

This study explored the effects of retrieval and feedback 
on test-potentiated new learning. Participants read a text 
divided into three parts, between which they engaged in 
either episodic retrieval, semantic retrieval, or 
rereading. Participants in the retrieval conditions were 
randomly assigned to either receive or not to receive 
feedback on their achievement. We administered 
multiple-choice questions whose distractors were designed 
specifically to facilitate proactive interference. Planned 
analyses showed that participants in the episodic retrieval 
condition scored higher on the final test than participants 
in the other two groups. Feedback was found to have no 
bearing on new learning --- neither on its own, nor via 
interaction with the interpolated activity type. No effect 
regarding the number of proactive intrusions was found, 
although exploratory Bayesian analyses preclude rejecting 
an effect. Results are interpreted in terms of 
metacognitive theories that have previously been suggested 
as an explanation of the effect.

Analyses conducted using the \textit{R} language
\citep{rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2019}.
Bootstrap conducted using the \textit{boot} package
\citep{cantyBootBootstrapSPlus2017}. Methods and analyses written using
\textit{rmarkdown} \citep{allaireRmarkdownDynamicDocuments2019} and
\textit{knitr} \citep{xieKnitrGeneralPurposePackage2019}. The package
\textit{car} \citep{foxCompanionAppliedRegression2011} was used to
obtain type III sums of squares. \textit{compute.es}
\citep{reComputeEsCompute2013} was used to obtain effect sizes for
contrasts. \textit{kableExtra} was used to help generate tables
\citep{zhuKableExtraConstructComplex2019}. Other utilities used are

\section{Open Practices Statement}

The analysis plan was preregistered on GitHub (\texttt{analysis-plan.md};
first commit of analysis plan: \texttt{b101f42}; final relevant commit:
\texttt{16afea3}), as were the hypotheses (\texttt{design.md}; first commit of hypotheses:
\texttt{b101f42}; final commit: \texttt{dd0f863}).  The repository also serves all
project materials, data and analyses scripts, together with the whole project
history. It can be found at
\censor{https://github.com/ffzg-erudito/inter-testing-feedback-2018}.
Materials are also available through \censor{https://osf.io/gk9a3/}. The data
is also hosted on
\censor{https://dataverse.ffzg.unizg.hr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.23669/JVNVNR}.

There were certain deviations from the original analysis plan.
Initially, we had planned to do a robustness check of our findings using
data with an additional exclusion criterion, based on the number of times
each participant had read each of the three parts of the main text. This analysis
was never conducted because (i) applying this criterion would have lead to
unacceptably low power and (ii) the participants' estimates of the number
of times they had read each part were similarly distributed across all conditions.
Further, we had planned to conduct a TOST procedure to test whether there is
no difference between the content-related and general-knowledge testing
groups. This analysis was not conducted because we did find a difference.
A Bayesian t-test was also considered for the same comparison, but was dropped
early on due to some conceptual concerns.

Also, our original second
hypothesis suggested a differential effect of 
activity type on PI rates. 
Specifically, we expected that participants engaging 
in episodic retrieval 
would display the lowest susceptibility to PI, 
followed by participants in 
the semantic retrieval condition, and finally by 
those tasked with 
rereading. Upon further examination of the literature, 
our expectations 
changed, but this had no bearing on the analyses, 
which remained the same 
nevertheless.
