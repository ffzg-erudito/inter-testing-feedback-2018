A quiz app that reads its questions from a spreadsheet
(see quiz.csv in this directory).
There is 1 question per page; the number of pages in the game
is determined by the number of questions in the CSV.
See the comment below about how to randomize the order of pages.

            ## to randomize the order of the questions, you could instead do:

            ## the random.sample technique, but assign into participant.vars
            ## instead of session.vars.
